1,SALT TOLERANCE ASSESSMENT OF AQUATIC AND WETLAND PLANTS: INCREASED SALINITY CAN RESHAPE AQUATIC VEGETATION COMMUNITIES,"TOOTOONCHI, MOHSEN;GETTYS, LYN A.;FERRELL, JASON A.;ERICKSON, JOHN E.;BHADHA, JEHANGIR H.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,2022,10.1007/s10750-022-04934-5,"SALINIZATION IS A GREAT THREAT TO WETLANDS AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS. INCREASED SALINITY CAN DISTURB NATIVE AQUATIC VEGETATION AND PROVIDE AN EMPTY NICHE FOR INVASION OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES. TO UNDERSTAND THE FATE OF AQUATIC FLORA UNDER INCREASED SALINITY LEVELS, 14 DOMINANT WETLAND SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT GROWTH FORMS (SUBMERSED, AMPHIBIOUS, FLOATING-LEAVED, EMERGENT AND WOODY/TREE) WERE EXPOSED TO INCREASED SALINITY CONDITIONS. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE SALT TOLERANCE THRESHOLD FOR EACH SPECIES AND MODEL THEIR PERFORMANCE IN RESPONSE TO A SALINITY GRADIENT RANGING FROM 0.2 TO 20 PARTS PER THOUSAND (PPT). PLANT GROWTH AND SURVIVAL RATE WERE ANALYZED USING A NONLINEAR REGRESSION MODEL TO PROJECT SUBLETHAL SALINITY CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD REDUCE BIOMASS AND VISUAL QUALITY OF EACH SPECIES BY 50% (LC50). RESULTS SHOWED THAT A FEW NON-NATIVE SPECIES (ALLIGATORWEED: ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES (MART.) GRISEB., TORPEDOGRASS: PANICUM REPENS L., AND BRAZILIAN PEPPERTREE: SCHINUS TEREBINTHIFOLIUS RADDI) SURVIVED 20 PPT SALINITY, WHEREAS ALL OTHER NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE SPECIES PERISHED AT SALINITY BELOW 10 PPT. INCREASED SALINITY CAN SUPPRESS SALT-SENSITIVE NATIVE PLANTS AND INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY OF INVASION FOR SALT-TOLERANT NON-NATIVE SPECIES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ALLIGATORWEED, TORPEDOGRASS AND BRAZILIAN PEPPERTREE POSE A MORE SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE ECOSYSTEM IF SALINITY LEVELS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND EXACERBATE THE ENCROACHMENT OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES INTO NATIVE PLANT COMMUNITIES.",ARTICLE,NON-NATIVE SPECIES;FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS;INCREASED SALINITY;NATIVE AQUATIC VEGETATION;NATIVE PLANT COMMUNITIES;AQUATIC VEGETATION COMMUNITIES;SALINITY LEVELS;DIFFERENT GROWTH FORMS;WETLAND SPECIES;VEGETATION COMMUNITIES;PLANT COMMUNITIES;AQUATIC VEGETATION;NATIVE PLANTS;AQUATIC FLORA;WETLAND PLANTS;SALT TOLERANCE THRESHOLD;EMPTY NICHES;GROWTH FORMS;SALINITY GRADIENT;ECOSYSTEMS;PLANT GROWTH;GREAT THREAT;SIGNIFICANT THREAT;SALINITY CONCENTRATIONS;SALINITY;SPECIES;SALINITY CONDITIONS;TOLERANCE THRESHOLD;COMMUNITY;THREAT;PPT SALINITY;PLANTS;WETLANDS;VEGETATION;INVASION;SALINIZATION;ENCROACHMENT;BIOMASS;FLORA;NICHE;TORPEDOGRASS;FATE;GRADIENT;TOLERANCE ASSESSMENT;NONLINEAR REGRESSION MODELS;ASSESSMENT;GROWTH;CONCENTRATION;PPT;REGRESSION MODELS;LEVELS;QUALITY;OBJECTIVE;OPPORTUNITIES;SURVIVAL RATE;RESPONSE;CONDITIONS;PART;THRESHOLD;RATE;FORM;RESULTS;MODEL;VISUAL QUALITY;PERFORMANCE,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE,NIFA,WASHINGTON D.C.,UNITED STATES",UNITED STATES;UNITED STATES;UNITED STATES;UNITED STATES;UNITED STATES;UNITED STATES,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,DIMENSIONS

PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS (PGRS) ARE WIDELY USED IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND MIGHT ALSO AFFECT INVASIVE WEEDS DISTRIBUTED AROUND CROPS IN VARIOUS WAYS. AT PRESENT, THERE ARE FEW STUDIES CONCERNING WHETHER THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF PGRS ON INVASIVE WEEDS.

THE RIVER-LAKE ECOTONE IS THE ECOLOGICAL BUFFER ZONE BETWEEN RIVERS AND LAKES, WHICH CAN TRANSFER ENERGY AND MATERIAL BETWEEN TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. VEGETATION RESTORATION OF DEGRADED RIVER-LAKE ECOTONE CAN IMPROVE THE INTERCEPTION CAPACITY OF P POLLUTION. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION RESTORATION TYPES ON SEDIMENT P CYCLING AND ITS MECHANISM REMAIN UNCLEAR. THEREFORE, WE SEASONALLY MEASURED THE P FRACTIONS AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SEDIMENTS FROM DIFFERENT RESTORED VEGETATION (THREE NATIVE SPECIES AND ONE INVASIVE SPECIES). THE RESULTS FOUND THAT VEGETATION RESTORATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SEDIMENT TOTAL P AND BIOAVAILABLE P CONTENT, WHICH INCREASED THE SEDIMENT TOLERANCE TO P POLLUTION IN RIVER-LAKE ECOTONE. IN ADDITION, THE TOTAL P CONTENT IN SEDIMENTS WAS HIGHEST IN SUMMER AND AUTUMN, BUT LOWER IN SPRING AND WINTER. THE TOTAL P AND BIOAVAILABLE P CONTENTS IN SURFACE SEDIMENTS WERE THE HIGHEST. THEY DECREASED WITH INCREASING DEPTH, SUGGESTING THAT SEDIMENT P ASSIMILATION BY VEGETATION RESTORATION AND THE RESULTING LITTER LEADS TO REDISTRIBUTION OF P IN DIFFERENT SEASONS AND SEDIMENT DEPTHS. MICROBIAL BIOMASS-P (MBP), TOTAL NITROGEN (TN), AND SEDIMENT ORGANIC MATTER (SOM) ARE THE MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING THE CHANGE OF SEDIMENT PHOSPHORUS FRACTIONS. ALL FOUR PLANTS' MAXIMUM BIOMASS AND P STORAGE APPEARED IN THE AUTUMN. ALTHOUGH THE BIOMASS AND P STORAGE OF THE INVASIVE SPECIES ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES WERE LOWER, THE HIGHER BIOAVAILABLE P CONTENT AND MBP VALUES OF THE SURFACE SEDIMENTS INDICATED THE UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY OF SEDIMENT RESOURCES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT VEGETATION RESTORATION AFFECTS THE DISTRIBUTION AND CIRCULATION OF P IN RIVER AND LAKE ECOSYSTEMS, WHICH FURTHER ENHANCES THE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE RIVER-LAKE ECOTONE AND PREVENTS THE EUTROPHICATION AND EROSION OF WATER AND SEDIMENT IN THE RIVER-LAKE ECOTONE.",ARTICLE,BIOAVAILABLE P CONTENT;VEGETATION RESTORATION;SEDIMENT ORGANIC MATTER;SEDIMENT PHOSPHORUS FRACTIONS;P CONTENT;P POLLUTION;P STORAGE;PHOSPHORUS FRACTIONS;TOTAL NITROGEN;SURFACE SEDIMENTS;DIFFERENT VEGETATION RESTORATION TYPES;VEGETATION RESTORATION TYPES;EUTROPHICATION OF RIVERS;ECOLOGICAL BUFFER ZONE;TOTAL P CONTENT;MAXIMUM BIOMASS;SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHANGES;EROSION OF WATER;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;P CYCLING;AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS;ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS;P FRACTIONS;LAKE ECOSYSTEMS;BUFFER ZONE;ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES;ORGANIC MATTER;ECOTONE;SEDIMENT TOLERANCE;SEDIMENT RESOURCES;RESTORATION TYPE;SEDIMENT DEPTH;INTERCEPTION CAPACITY;ECOSYSTEMS;P ASSIMILATION;RIVER;SEDIMENTS;BIOMASS;RESTORATION;EUTROPHICATION;DIFFERENT SEASONS;POLLUTION;LAKES;AUTUMN;MAIN FACTORS;VEGETATION;PHILOXEROIDES;PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES;DEPTH;LITTER;PHOSPHORUS;CYCLING;EROSION;SEASON;CONTENT;NITROGEN;SUMMER;SPRING;WINTER;ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS;UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY;MATTER;WATER;CHANGES;ZONE;FRACTION;STORAGE;RESOURCES;MBP VALUES;DISTRIBUTION;ASSIMILATION;REDISTRIBUTION;TOLERANCE;CAPACITY;MECHANISM;RESULTS;TYPES;FUNCTION;FACTORS;RESPONSE;VALUES;EFFECT;ELEMENTS;CIRCULATION;ADDITION;CAUSE;EFFICIENCY;PROPERTIES;MATERIALS;ENERGY,,CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA,WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY;WUHAN UNIVERSITY,DIMENSIONS

SINGLE-NODE FRAGMENTS WITH STOLON INTERNODE OF DIFFERENT LENGTH WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF STOLON STORAGE ON SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF THREE STOLONIFEROUS INVASIVE PLANTS (WEDELIA TRILOBATA, ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES AND HYDROCOTYLE VULGARIS) AND THEIR CONGENERIC NATIVE SPECIES (WEDELIA CHINENSIS, ALTERNANTHERA SESSILIS AND HYDROCOTYLE SIBTHORPIOIDES). SOLUBLE SUGAR, STARCH AND SOLUBLE PROTEIN CONTENTS OF STOLON INTERNODE PER UNIT LENGTH WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN THE THREE INVASIVE PLANTS THAN IN THEIR CONGENERIC NATIVE SPECIES. DURING THE EXPERIMENT, REGENERATION OF CLONAL FRAGMENTS WAS NOT OBSERVED IN A. SESSILIS. WITH INCREASING OF STOLON INTERNODE LENGTH, ACCUMULATIVE EMERGENCE RATE OF CLONAL FRAGMENTS AND BIOMASS OF THEIR REGENERATED RAMETS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE OTHER FIVE SPECIES. ACCUMULATIVE EMERGENCE RATE OF CLONAL FRAGMENTS AND BIOMASS OF THEIR REGENERATED RAMETS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN INVASIVE PLANT H. VULGARIS THAN IN ITS CONGENERIC NATIVE SPECIES. A SIMILAR PATTERN WAS OBSERVED IN THE CLONAL FRAGMENTS WITH STOLON INTERNODE OF LONG AND MEDIUM LENGTH FOR WEDELIA SPECIES PAIR. IN THE EXPERIMENT, REGENERATION CAPACITY OF CLONAL FRAGMENTS VARIED WITH SPECIES AND STOLON INTERNODE LENGTH. CLONAL FRAGMENTS OF STOLONIFEROUS INVASIVE PLANTS BENEFIT MORE FROM STOLON STORAGE THAN THEIR CONGENERIC NATIVE SPECIES. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT CLONAL STORAGE MAY BE AN IMPORTANT TRAIT FOR INVASIVENESS OF STOLONIFEROUS INVASIVE PLANTS. THEREFORE, INTENTIONAL FRAGMENTATION SHOULD BE CAREFULLY EMPLOYED TO MANAGE STOLONIFEROUS INVASIVE PLANTS AND AVOID THE DISPERSAL OF GENERATIVE CLONAL FRAGMENTS.",ARTICLE,CONGENERIC NATIVE SPECIES;STOLON INTERNODE LENGTH;NATIVE SPECIES;INVASIVE PLANTS;INTERNODE LENGTH;STOLON INTERNODES;EMERGENCE RATE;SINGLE-NODE FRAGMENTS;REGENERATION CAPACITY;INVASIVE CLONAL PLANT;SOLUBLE PROTEIN CONTENT;CLONAL FRAGMENTS;IMPORTANT TRAITS;SOLUBLE SUGARS;CLONAL PLANTS;CLONAL ORGANS;FREQUENT DISTURBANCES;A.

THE STRONG CLONAL ABILITY MAY HELP INVASIVE SPECIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS. TO INVESTIGATE THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SOIL NUTRIENTS AND WATER HETEROGENEITY ON THE GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF EXOTIC AND NATIVE AQUATIC PLANTS, WE CONDUCTED A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT WITH THE NOTORIOUS INVASIVE SPECIES ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES AND MYRIOPHYLLUM AQUATICUM COMPARED WITH SIMILAR LIFE FORMS OF NATIVE SPECIES LUDWIGIA PEPLOIDES. WE GREW EACH SPECIES IN CONTAINERS IN TWO HETEROGENEOUS SOILS CONSISTING OF PATCHES OF NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS, MIXED EVENLY, AND LOW-NUTRIENT SOILS, AND IN SOILS WHERE THE NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS SOILS WERE MIXED HOMOGENEOUSLY. THE EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT WITH HOMOGENEOUS OR HETEROGENEOUS WATER TREATMENTS TO EXAMINE HOW THE INTERACTION WITH THE SOIL TREATMENTS. OVERALL, ALL THREE SPECIES INCREASED OR MAINTAINED THEIR GROWTH PERFORMANCE IN HETEROGENEOUS SOILS COMPARED WITH HOMOGENEOUS SOILS.

WE ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF WATER AVAILABILITY, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, AND PLANT DENSITY (SPACE) IN A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT. IN FIELD SURVEYS, INFLORESCENCE BIOMASS, NORMAL MONOCLINOUS FLOWERS AND RATIO OF INFLORESCENCES TO SHOOTS OF PLANTS FROM WETLANDS WERE ABOUT 2.4-, 0.8- AND 1.3-FOLD HIGHER THAN THOSE FROM TERRESTRIAL HABITATS, RESPECTIVELY. IN GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT, PLANTS WITH HIGHER FERTILIZER APPLICATION AND LOWER COMPETITION CONDITIONS PRODUCED MORE INFLORESCENCES, AND HAD A LOWER RATIO OF ROOTS TO SHOOTS AND A COMPARABLE RATIO OF INFLORESCENCES TO SHOOT AND ROOT. FURTHERMORE, WATER AVAILABILITY HAD A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIVE EFFECT WHEN COMBINED WITH FERTILIZER LEVEL OR PLANT DENSITY ON INFLORESCENCE PRODUCTION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT HIGH RESOURCES, SUCH AS THOSE FOUND IN WETLAND HABITATS, FAVOR BOTH VEGETATIVE GROWTH AND SEXUAL TRAIT IN A. PHILOXEROIDES.

THEREFORE, WE COLLECTED PLANT SAMPLES FROM WITHIN VEGETATED RUNOFF COLLECTION CHANNELS AND TREATMENT STAGES OF TWO CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEMS RECEIVING IRRIGATION RUNOFF AT A COMMERCIAL PLANT NURSERY IN CAIRO, GA, TO DETERMINE IF ROOTS OF WETLAND PLANTS WERE INFESTED BY SPECIES OF PHYTOPHTHORA . SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED 12 TIMES, AT 1- TO 2-MONTH INTERVALS, OVER A 19-MONTH PERIOD, FROM MAR. 2011 THROUGH SEPT. 2012. THE SAMPLE PERIOD COVERED ALL FOUR SEASONS OF THE YEAR, SO WE COULD DETERMINE IF THE ASSOCIATION OF PHYTOPHTHORA SPECIES WITH ROOTS OF SPECIFIC PLANT SPECIES VARIED WITH SEASON. APPROXIMATELY 340 SAMPLES FROM 14 WETLAND PLANT SPECIES WERE COLLECTED, AND 22 ISOLATES OF PHYTOPHTHORA SPECIES WERE RECOVERED. PHYTOPHTHORA SPECIES WERE TYPICALLY ISOLATED FROM PLANTS IN CHANNELS RECEIVING RUNOFF WATER DIRECTLY FROM PLANT PRODUCTION AREAS; PHYTOPHTHORA SPECIES WERE NOT DETECTED ON PLANTS WHERE WATER LEAVES THE NURSERY. NO SEASONAL PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED IN PLANT INFESTATION OR PRESENCE OF SPECIES OF PHYTOPHTHORA . IN FACT, PHYTOPHTHORA SPECIES WERE RARELY FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROOTS OF THE WETLAND PLANTS COLLECTED; SPECIES OF PHYTOPHTHORA WERE FOUND INFESTING ROOTS OF ONLY 6.5% OF THE 336 PLANTS SAMPLED. SPECIES OF PHYTOPHTHORA WERE NOT FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROOTS OF GOLDEN CANNA ( CANNA FLACCIDA ), LAMP RUSH ( JUNCUS EFFUSUS VAR. SOLUTUS ), DUCKWEED ( LEMNA VALDIVIANA ), OR SEDGES ( CAREX SP.) DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. THE EXOTIC INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES MARSH DAYFLOWER [ MURDANNIA KEISAK (33% OF SAMPLES INFESTED)] AND ALLIGATORWEED [ ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES (15% OF SAMPLES INFESTED)] WERE FOUND TO HAVE THE FIRST AND THIRD HIGHEST, RESPECTIVELY, INCIDENCES OF INFESTATION, WITH SMOOTH BEGGARTICK ( BIDENS LAEVIS ) HAVING THE SECOND HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF SAMPLES INFESTED (22%). MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE SPECIES IN DRAINAGE CANALS AND CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEMS MAY BE CRITICAL BECAUSE OF THEIR POTENTIAL PROPENSITY TOWARD INFESTATION BY PHYTOPHTHORA SPECIES. PLANT SPECIES RECOMMENDED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION FOR USE IN CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS TO REMEDIATE IRRIGATION RUNOFF INCLUDE GOLDEN CANNA, MARSH PENNYWORT ( HYDROCOTYLE UMBELLATA ), PICKERELWEED ( PONTEDERIA CORDATA ), AND BROADLEAF CATTAIL ( TYPHA LATIFOLIA ). THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT FIRST LOOK AT THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SPECIES OF PHYTOPHTHORA AND WETLAND PLANTS IN CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEMS TREATING IRRIGATION RUNOFF AND WILL SERVE TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE THE DESIGN OF CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS AND OTHER VEGETATION-BASED TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE REMOVAL OF PLANT PATHOGENS FROM IRRIGATION RUNOFF.

HYGROPHILA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TOTAL MASS AND ABOVEGROUND DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH PLANT SPECIES, AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HERBIVORY ON LEAF MASS, RAMET NUMBER, AND LEAF NUMBER WERE MORE REMARKABLE AT THE HIGH THAN AT THE LOW NITROGEN LEVEL. ON THE OTHER HAND, HERBIVORY DID NOT AFFECT ROOT MASS AND EVEN INCREASED ROOT TO SHOOT RATIO OF BOTH PLANT SPECIES. THE INCREASE IN ROOT TO SHOOT RATIO AND RELATIVE RATIO OF ROOT MASS CAUSED BY HERBIVORY WAS ALSO STRONGER IN A. PHILOXEROIDES THAN IN A. SESSILIS. BESIDES, HERBIVORY EXERTED NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE CONCENTRATIONS OF STARCH AND TOTAL NON-STRUCTURAL CARBOHYDRATES IN STEMS AND ROOTS OF A. PHILOXEROIDES, BUT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF A. SESSILIS. WE CONCLUDE THAT A. PHILOXEROIDES MAY POSSESS A STRONGER TOLERANCE TO HERBIVORY THAN A. SESSILIS AND THAT INCREASED RESOURCE ALLOCATION TO ROOTS COULD POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO COMPENSATORY RESPONSES OF A. PHILOXEROIDES TO ABOVEGROUND HERBIVORY.

WE USED A COMBINATION OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF FOLIAR NITROGEN (FN) THAT LARVAE OF THE ALLIGATORWEED FLEA BEETLE (AGASICLES HYGROPHILA) ARE EXPOSED TO IN THE FIELD AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO LARVAL DEVELOPMENT AND DISPERSAL. SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN FN WAS ASSESSED AT FIELD SITES SPANNING SOUTHERN TO NORTHERN LOUISIANA EVERY 23 WEEKS DURING THE GROWING SEASON FOR FOUR YEARS. IN A SERIES OF LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, ALLIGATORWEED FN WAS MANIPULATED TO EXAMINE ITS INFLUENCE ON LARVAL DEVELOPMENT AND SURVIVAL (UNDER DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE REGIMES), ADULT BIOMASS, AND DISPERSAL OF THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT, A. HYGROPHILA. THERE WAS STRONG SEASONALITY OF FN IN FIELD SITES WITH PEAK LEVELS (48% DRY WEIGHT NITROGEN; DW N) RECORDED EARLY DURING EACH YEAR, DECLINING DURING SUMMER, AND SLIGHTLY INCREASING AGAIN IN THE FALL WHICH COINCIDES WITH FLEA BEETLE ACTIVITY. FOLIAR NITROGEN AND REARING TEMPERATURE HAD STRONG INDEPENDENT EFFECTS ON LARVAL DEVELOPMENT RATE. HIGH FN INCREASED SURVIVAL BY 40%, DECREASED DEVELOPMENTAL TIME BY 15%, AND RESULTED IN 11% LARGER ADULTS. INCREASING TEMPERATURE REDUCED SURVIVAL BY 43%, SHORTENED DEVELOPMENTAL TIME BY 28%, AND LED TO 15% SMALLER ADULTS. IN THE DISPERSAL EXPERIMENT WE WERE UNABLE TO DETECT AN INTERACTION BETWEEN FN AND CONSPECIFIC DENSITY ON LARVAL DISPERSAL, THOUGH RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT FN MAY LESSEN EFFECTS AT MODERATE DENSITIES. MEAN DISPERSAL WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE IN THE LOW VERSUS HIGH FN TREATMENT (51% VS. 23%). LARVAL DENSITY AND NITROGEN BOTH AFFECTED LARVAL WEIGHT; HIGH NITROGEN PLANTS PRODUCED 33% LARGER LARVAE OVER THE DURATION OF THE EXPERIMENT AND LARVAL FRESH WEIGHT DECREASED BY 38% FROM LOW (ONE LARVA PLANT-1) TO HIGH (TWENTY LARVAE PLANT-1) DENSITY TREATMENTS. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT INCREASING NITROGEN IN LEAF TISSUES SHORTENS LARVAL A. HYGROPHILA DEVELOPMENTAL TIME AND INCREASES SURVIVAL TO ADULTHOOD, REGARDLESS OF EXPOSURE TEMPERATURE DURING DEVELOPMENT. IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT FOLIAR NITROGEN MAY HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF ALLIGATORWEED, PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF SEASONAL VARIATION IN TEMPERATURE AND PLANT NUTRITION AT FIELD SITES, AND COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OBSERVED VARIATION IN A.

TO WHAT EXTENT THIS APPLIES TO INVASIVE SPECIES AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS VARIATION ARE FOR COMPETITION AMONG NATIVE AND INVASIVE SPECIES REMAIN UNEXPLORED. HERE, HERBIVORE IMPACTS ON THE INVASIVE PLANT ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES AND ITS COMPETITION WITH THE NATIVE CONGENER A. SESSILIS WERE ESTIMATED ACROSS LATITUDES IN CHINA.
METHODS: AN COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENT SPANNING TEN LATITUDINAL DEGREES WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST HOW HERBIVORE IMPACTS ON A. PHILOXEROIDES AND A. SESSILIS, AND COMPETITION BETWEEN THEM CHANGE WITH LATITUDE. IN ADDITION, A FIELD SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FROM 21°N TO 36.8°N TO TEST WHETHER A. PHILOXEROIDES INVASIVENESS CHANGES WITH LATITUDE IN NATURE AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS IN HERBIVORY.
KEY RESULTS: IN THE EXPERIMENT, A. SESSILIS COVER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN A. PHILOXEROIDES COVER WHEN THEY COMPETED IN THE ABSENCE OF HERBIVORES, BUT OTHERWISE THEIR COVER WAS COMPARABLE AT LOW LATITUDE. HOWEVER, A. PHILOXEROIDES COVER WAS ALWAYS HIGHER ON AVERAGE THAN A. SESSILIS COVER AT MIDDLE LATITUDE. AT HIGH LATITUDE, ONLY A. SESSILIS EMERGED IN THE SECOND YEAR. HERBIVORE ABUNDANCE DECREASED WITH LATITUDE AND A. PHILOXEROIDES EMERGED EARLIER THAN A. SESSILIS AT MIDDLE LATITUDE. IN THE FIELD SURVEY, THE RATIO OF A. PHILOXEROIDES TO A. SESSILIS COVER WAS HUMP SHAPED WITH LATITUDE.
CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT HERBIVORY MAY PROMOTE A. PHILOXEROIDES INVASION ONLY AT LOW LATITUDE BY ALTERING THE OUTCOME OF COMPETITION IN FAVOUR OF THE INVADER AND POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS EARLIER EMERGENCE, IN A.

THESE POSITIVE AND/OR NEGATIVE ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS MAY BE ENHANCED UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE. HERE, WE EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE ON AQUATIC ALIEN PLANT INTRODUCTION AND/OR INVASIONS BY REVIEWING THEIR INTRODUCTION PATHWAYS, DISTRIBUTIONS, AND ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS. WE FOCUS ON HOW CLIMATE CHANGE, AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, AND CHINA'S RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH IN RECENT DECADES AFFECT THEIR USES AND INVASIVENESS IN CHINA. AMONG 55 SPECIES OF ALIEN AQUATIC PLANTS IN CHINA, 10 SPECIES ARE INVASIVE, SUCH AS <I>EICHHORNIA CRASSIPES</I>, <I>ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES</I>, AND <I>PISTIA STRATIOTES</I>. MOST OF THESE INVADERS WERE INTENTIONALLY INTRODUCED AND DISPERSED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT ARE NOW WIDELY DISTRIBUTED AND INVASIVE. UNDER CLIMATE WARMING, MANY SPECIES HAVE EXPANDED THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS TO AREAS WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY TOO COLD FOR THEIR SURVIVAL. THUS, THESE SPECIES ARE (AND WILL BE) CONSIDERED TO BE BENEFICIAL PLANTS IN AQUACULTURE AND FOR THE RESTORATION OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS (FOR WATER PURIFICATION) ACROSS LARGER AREAS. HOWEVER, FOR POTENTIAL INVASIVE SPECIES, CLIMATE WARMING IS (AND WILL BE) INCREASING THEIR INVASION RISK IN MORE AREAS. IN ADDITION, NITROGEN DEPOSITION AND PHOSPHORUS INPUTS MAY ALSO ALTER THE STATUS OF SOME ALIEN SPECIES. FURTHERMORE, CLIMATE WARMING HAS SHIFTED THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ALIEN AQUATIC PLANTS AND HERBIVORES, THUS IMPACTING THEIR FUTURE SPREADS. UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE, MORE PRECIPITATION IN NORTH CHINA AND MORE FREQUENT FLOODING IN SOUTH CHINA WILL INCREASE THE UNCERTAINTIES OF ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ALIEN AQUATIC PLANTS IN THESE REGIONS. WE ALSO PREDICT THAT, UNDER THE CONTINUING BOOMING ECONOMY IN CHINA, MORE AND MORE ALIEN AQUATIC PLANTS WILL BE USED FOR AQUATIC LANDSCAPING AND WATER PURIFICATION. IN CONCLUSION, OUR STUDY INDICATES THAT BOTH HUMAN ACTIVITIES UNDER RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE CAN EITHER INCREASE THE POTENTIAL USES OF ALIEN AQUATIC PLANTS OR MAKE THE AQUATIC INVADERS WORSE IN CHINA AND OTHER AREAS IN THE WORLD.

ALLIGATOR WEED (THE WORLDS FIRST AQUATIC WEED) IS A SERIOUS INVASIVE WEED IN 32 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF SOUTH AMERICA, AUSTRALIA, ASIA, AND NORTH AMERICA. RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN RECORDED AS A THREAT WEED OF RICE, MAIZE, SOYBEAN, VEGETABLES, FRUIT TREES, AND PASTURES, CAUSING 1945% YIELD LOSSES IN THESE CROPS IN ADDITION TO ITS INFESTATION IN CANALS, LAKES, AND DITCHES. ALLIGATOR WEED HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RUIN AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND RECREATIONAL AREAS. ABILITY TO PROPAGATE VIA VEGETATIVE FRAGMENTATION, WATER-BORNE DISPERSAL OF VEGETATIVE PROPAGULES, AND ALLELOPATHIC POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS ITS SUCCESS AS AN INVASIVE WEED SPECIES OF TERRESTRIAL, SEMI-AQUATIC, AND AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS. APPLICATION OF GLYPHOSATE, METSULFURON-METHYL, DICHLOBENIL, FLURIDONE, HEXAZINONE, TRICLOPYR AMINE, DIMETHYLAMINE, IMAZAPYR, DIURON, AND AMITROLE HERBICIDES HAVE BEEN FOUND MOST EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING THIS WEED IN DIFFERENT HABITATS. AGASICLES HYGROPHILA, VOGTIA MALLOI PASTANA, AMYNOTHRIPS ANDERSONI, AND NIMBYA ALTERNANTHERA HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS BIO-AGENTS FOR THE CONTROL OF ALLIGATOR WEED. WE PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE BIOLOGY, INTERFERENCE, AND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS OF AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS INVASIVE WEED SPECIES. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT OF ALLIGATOR WEED THROUGH CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND MECHANICAL MEANS ARE OFTEN EFFECTIVE, THERE IS NEED FOR WELL-PLANNED, LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE STATED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS INCREASING INFESTATION AND DISTRIBUTION (E.G., REGENERATION AFTER DAMAGE CAUSED BY HERBICIDES, HIGH SOIL FERTILITY LEVELS, SOIL DISTURBANCES, SHALLOW VS.

76,THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IN DETERMINING INVASION SUCCESS OF A CLONAL WEED IN THE USA AND CHINA,"GENG, YUPENG;VAN KLINKEN, RIEKS D.;SOSA, ALEJANDRO;LI, BO;CHEN, JIAKUAN;XU, CHENG-YUAN",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.00213,"PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN IMPORTANT ADAPTIVE STRATEGY FOR CLONAL PLANTS IN HETEROGENEOUS HABITATS. INCREASED PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY CAN BE ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR INVASIVE CLONAL PLANTS, ALLOWING THEM TO COLONIZE NEW ENVIRONMENTS EVEN WHEN GENETIC DIVERSITY IS LOW. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY FOR INVASION SUCCESS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE, WE PERFORMED MOLECULAR MARKER ANALYSES AND A COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE GENETIC DIVERSITY AND PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY OF THE GLOBALLY IMPORTANT WEED ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT WATER AVAILABILITY (TERRESTRIAL VS. AQUATIC HABITATS). THIS SPECIES RELIES PREDOMINANTLY ON CLONAL PROPAGATION IN INTRODUCED RANGES. WE THEREFORE EXPECTED GENETIC DIVERSITY TO BE RESTRICTED IN THE TWO SAMPLED INTRODUCED RANGES (THE USA AND CHINA) WHEN COMPARED TO THE NATIVE RANGE (ARGENTINA), BUT THAT PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY MAY ALLOW THE SPECIES' FULL NICHE RANGE TO NONETHELESS BE EXPLOITED. WE FOUND CLONES FROM CHINA HAD VERY LOW GENETIC DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF BOTH MARKER DIVERSITY AND QUANTITATIVE VARIATION WHEN COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM THE USA AND ARGENTINA, PROBABLY REFLECTING DIFFERENT INTRODUCTION HISTORIES. IN CONTRAST, SIMILAR PATTERNS OF PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY WERE FOUND FOR CLONES FROM ALL THREE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, DESPITE THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY, BIOCLIMATIC MODELING SUGGESTED THAT THE FULL POTENTIAL BIOCLIMATIC DISTRIBUTION HAD BEEN INVADED IN BOTH CHINA AND USA. PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, NOT GENETIC DIVERSITY, WAS THEREFORE CRITICAL IN ALLOWING A. PHILOXEROIDES TO INVADE DIVERSE HABITATS ACROSS BROAD GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

FIELD STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTS IN SOUTHEASTERN TEXAS TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT HERBICIDE OPTIONS INVOLVING PENOXSULAM, PROPANIL, TRICLOPYR, HALOSULFURON, BISPYRIBAC-SODIUM, BENSULFURON, AND QUINCLORAC FOR ALLIGATORWEED CONTROL IN CONVENTIONAL DRILL-SEEDED RICE WHEN APPLIED AT EARLY POST (EPOST), LATE POST (LPOST), OR BOTH. AMONG THE HERBICIDE OPTIONS EVALUATED, PENOXSULAM ALONE (UP TO 83%), PENOXSULAM PLUS TRICLOPYR (UP TO 87%), OR BISPYRIBAC-SODIUM PLUS TRICLOPYR (92%) PROVIDED SUPERIOR ALLIGATORWEED CONTROL.

SE REALIZARON ESTUDIOS DE CAMPO EN MÚLTIPLES AMBIENTES EN EL SURESTE DE TEXAS, PARA EVALUAR DIFERENTES OPCIONES DE HERBICIDAS QUE CONSISTIERON DE PENOXSULAM, PROPANIL, TRICLOPYR, HALOSULFURON, BISPYRIBAC-SODIUM, BENSULFURON, Y QUINCLORAC PARA EL CONTROL DE

78,SPECIALIST INSECT HERBIVORE AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY DO NOT INTERACT IN THE EVOLUTION OF AN INVASIVE PLANT,"ZHANG, ZHIJIE;PAN, XIAOYUN;ZHANG, ZIYAN;HE, KATE S.;LI, BO",PLOS ONE,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0139234,"RELEASE FROM SPECIALIST INSECT HERBIVORES MAY ALLOW INVASIVE PLANTS TO EVOLVE TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RESISTANCE AND INCREASED COMPETITIVE ABILITY. GIVEN THAT THERE MAY BE GENETIC TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND TOLERANCE, INVASIVE PLANTS COULD ALSO BECOME MORE TOLERANT TO HERBIVORES. ALTHOUGH IT IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LIGHT AVAILABILITY AFFECTS TOLERANCE TO HERBIVORES, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR WHETHER THE EFFECT OF LIGHT AVAILABILITY ON TOLERANCE DIFFER BETWEEN THE INTRODUCED AND NATIVE POPULATIONS. WE CONDUCTED A COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENT IN THE INTRODUCED RANGE OF ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES USING TEN INVASIVE US AND TEN NATIVE ARGENTINEAN POPULATIONS AT TWO LEVELS OF LIGHT AVAILABILITY AND IN THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A SPECIALIST STEM-BORING INSECT AGASICLES HYGROPHILA. PLANT BIOMASS (TOTAL AND STORAGE ROOT BIOMASS), TWO ALLOCATION TRAITS (ROOT/SHOOT RATIO AND BRANCH INTENSITY, BRANCHES BIOMASS/MAIN STEM BIOMASS) AND TWO FUNCTIONAL TRAITS (SPECIFIC STEM LENGTH AND SPECIFIC LEAF AREA), WHICH ARE POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HERBIVORE RESISTANCE AND LIGHT CAPTURE, WERE MEASURED. OVERALL, WE FOUND THAT A. PHILOXEROIDES FROM INTRODUCED RANGES HAD COMPARABLE BIOMASS AND TOLERANCE TO SPECIALIST HERBIVORES, LOWER BRANCH INTENSITY, LOWER SPECIFIC STEM LENGTH AND SPECIFIC LEAF AREA. MOREOVER, INTRODUCED POPULATIONS DISPLAYED HIGHER SHADE TOLERANCE OF STORAGE ROOT BIOMASS AND LOWER PLASTIC RESPONSE TO SHADING IN SPECIFIC STEM LENGTH. FINALLY, LIGHT AVAILABILITY HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EVOLUTION OF TOLERANCE TO SPECIALIST HERBIVORES OF A. PHILOXEROIDES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POST-INTRODUCTION EVOLUTION MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED IN A. PHILOXEROIDES.

82,RECURRENT WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION ALLEVIATES THE EFFECTS OF SUBMERGENCE STRESS ON THE INVASIVE RIPARIAN PLANT ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES,"ZHANG, HAIJIE;WANG, RENQING;WANG, XIAO;DU, NING;GE, XIULI;DU, YUANDA;LIU, JIAN",PLOS ONE,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0129549,"RECURRENT WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION AND SUBMERGENCE OF PLANTS ARE COMMON IN RIPARIAN ZONES. OUR STUDY OBJECTIVES WERE TO TEST THE INDEPENDENT AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF SUBMERGENCE LEVEL AND FLUCTUATION FREQUENCY ON A GLOBALLY IMPORTANT RIPARIAN INVASIVE PLANT, ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES. TO THIS END, WE CONDUCTED A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT, IN WHICH RAMETS OF THE PLANTS, OBTAINED FROM A WETLAND IN CHINA, WERE TREATED WITH FOUR FLUCTUATION FREQUENCIES (0, 3, 6, AND 12 CYCLES OVER A 96-DAY EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD) UNDER THREE WATER LEVELS (0, 10, AND 30 CM). WE FOUND THAT EFFECTS OF FLUCTUATION FREQUENCY WERE NON-SIGNIFICANT, NEGATIVE, AND POSITIVE UNDER WATER LEVELS OF 0, 10 AND 30 CM, RESPECTIVELY. AS FLUCTUATION FREQUENCY INCREASED, THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING WATER LEVEL DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WHEN WATER LEVELS WERE HIGH, A. PHILOXEROIDES ALLOCATED GREATER BIOMASS TO SHOOT PRODUCTION PROBABLY IN ORDER TO ELONGATE AND ESCAPE FROM SUBMERGENCE. HOWEVER, AS FLUCTUATION FREQUENCY INCREASED, BIOMASS INVESTMENT IN ROOTS AND LEAVES ALSO INCREASED, PROBABLY IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE NUTRIENT ABSORPTION AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION MAY ALLEVIATE THE EFFECTS OF SUBMERGENCE ON A. PHILOXEROIDES. IN ADDITION, A. PHILOXEROIDES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, ADJUSTING ITS FUNCTIONAL TRAITS, SUCH AS NUMBER OF NODES AND LEAVES PER STEM, AS WELL AS STEM DIAMETER AND PITH CAVITY DIAMETER, ACCORDING TO RECURRENT WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT A. PHILOXEROIDES MAY PERFORM BETTER IN SHALLOW WATER ZONES UNDER CONDITIONS OF DISTURBANCE THAT INCLUDE RECURRENT WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION.

83,SPATIAL ARRANGEMENTS AFFECT SUPPRESSION OF INVASIVE ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES BY NATIVE HEMARTHRIA COMPRESSA,"LIAO, JIANXIONG;TAO, MIN;JIANG, MINGXI",ACTA OECOLOGICA,2014,10.1016/j.actao.2014.05.010,"IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT DIFFERENCES IN SPATIAL ARRANGEMENTS CHANGE THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES. MANIPULATING SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT MAY PLAY A ROLE IN INVASIVE PLANT SUPPRESSION WHEN NATIVE SPECIES ARE USED AS COMPETITORS AGAINST INTRODUCED SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, A REPLACEMENT SERIES EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INTRASPECIFICALLY RANDOM AND AGGREGATED SPATIAL ARRANGEMENTS ON INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE NATIVE PLANT HEMARTHRIA COMPRESSA AND THE INVASIVE PLANT ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES, TO TEST THE POSSIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF H. COMPRESSA IN SUPPRESSING A. PHILOXEROIDES.

TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, TWO STOLONIFEROUS CLONAL PLANTS, ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES (INVASIVE), JUSSIAEA REPENS (NATIVE) WERE STUDIED IN CHINA. THE APICAL PARTS OF BOTH SPECIES WERE GROWN EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT NEIGHBORING VEGETATION AND THE BASAL PARTS WITHOUT COMPETITORS WERE IN NUTRIENT- RICH OR -POOR HABITATS, WITH STOLON CONNECTIONS WERE EITHER SEVERED OR KEPT INTACT. COMPETITION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC PERFORMANCE OF THE APICAL RAMETS IN BOTH SPECIES, BUT NOT THE BIOMASS OF NEIGHBORING VEGETATION. WITHOUT COMPETITION, CLONAL INTEGRATION GREATLY IMPROVED THE GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC PERFORMANCE OF BOTH SPECIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BASAL PARTS WERE IN NUTRIENT-RICH HABITATS. WHEN GROWN WITH NEIGHBORING VEGETATION, GROWTH OF J. REPENS AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC PERFORMANCE OF BOTH SPECIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY CLONAL INTEGRATION WITH THE BASAL PARTS IN BOTH NUTRIENT-RICH AND -POOR HABITATS, WHILE GROWTH AND RELATIVE NEIGHBOR EFFECT (RNE) OF A.

PHILOXEROIDES'S BIOMASS ALLOCATION TO ROOTS WITHOUT COMPETITION, BUT DECREASED IT WITH COMPETITION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BASAL RAMETS WERE IN NUTRIENT-RICH SECTIONS. EFFECTS OF CLONAL INTEGRATION ON BIOMASS ALLOCATION OF J. REPENS WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF A. PHILOXEROIDES BUT WITH LESS SIGNIFICANCE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORTED OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT INVASIVE CLONAL PLANTS A. PHILOXEROIDES BENEFITS FROM CLONAL INTEGRATION MORE THAN CO-OCCURRING NATIVE J. REPENS, SUGGESTING THAT THE INVASIVENESS OF A.

USING ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES (ALLIGATOR WEED) AS AN EXAMPLE, THIS STUDY TESTED THE HYPOTHESES THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL INTEGRATION WILL IMPROVE GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY OF SUBMERGED RAMETS DURING SUBMERGENCE AND WILL PROMOTE THEIR RECOVERY FOLLOWING DE-SUBMERGENCE.
METHODS: CONNECTED CLONES OF A. PHILOXEROIDES, EACH CONSISTING OF TWO RAMET SYSTEMS AND A STOLON INTERNODE CONNECTING THEM, WERE GROWN UNDER CONTROL (BOTH RAMET SYSTEMS UNTREATED), HALF-SUBMERGED (ONE RAMET SYSTEM SUBMERGED AND THE OTHER NOT SUBMERGED), FULLY SUBMERGED (BOTH RAMET SYSTEMS SUBMERGED), HALF-SHADED (ONE RAMET SYSTEM SHADED AND THE OTHER NOT SHADED) AND FULL-SHADED (BOTH RAMET SYSTEMS SHADED) CONDITIONS FOR 30 D AND THEN DE-SUBMERGED/DE-SHADED FOR 20 D. THE SUBMERGED PLANTS WERE ALSO SHADED TO VERY LOW LIGHT INTENSITIES, MIMICKING TYPICAL CONDITIONS IN TURBID FLOODWATER.
KEY RESULTS: AFTER 30 D OF SUBMERGENCE, CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SUBMERGED AND NON-SUBMERGED RAMETS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED GROWTH AND CARBOHYDRATE ACCUMULATION OF THE SUBMERGED RAMETS, BUT DECREASED THE GROWTH OF THE NON-SUBMERGED RAMETS. AFTER 20 D OF DE-SUBMERGENCE, CONNECTIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF EITHER DE-SUBMERGED OR NON-SUBMERGED RAMETS, BUT DE-SUBMERGED RAMETS HAD HIGH SOLUBLE SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS, SUGGESTING HIGH METABOLIC ACTIVITIES. THE SHIFT FROM SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF INTEGRATION ON BOTH SUBMERGED AND NON-SUBMERGED RAMETS DURING THE SUBMERGENCE PERIOD TO LITTLE EFFECT DURING THE DE-SUBMERGENCE PERIOD WAS DUE TO THE QUICK RECOVERY OF GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THE EFFECTS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL INTEGRATION WERE NOT FOUND TO BE ANY STRONGER UNDER SUBMERGENCE/DE-SUBMERGENCE THAN UNDER SHADING/DE-SHADING.
CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS NOT JUST THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL INTEGRATION THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF RIPARIAN CLONAL PLANTS DURING PERIODS OF SUBMERGENCE, BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO RECOVER GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS RAPIDLY AFTER DE-SUBMERGENCE, WHICH THUS ALLOWS THEM TO SPREAD.",ARTICLE,PHYSIOLOGICAL INTEGRATION;CLONAL PLANTS;DE-SUBMERGENCE;HIGHER SOLUBLE SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS;SOLUBLE SUGAR CONCENTRATION;RIPARIAN PLANTS;PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY;A.

INVASIVE EXOTIC PLANTS MAY PRODUCE LITTER THAT DIFFERS FROM NATIVE PLANT LITTER IN QUALITY AND QUANTITY. SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY IMPACT LITTER DECOMPOSITION AND SOIL RESPIRATION IN WAYS THAT DEPEND ON WHETHER EXOTIC AND NATIVE PLANT LITTERS DECOMPOSE IN MIXTURES. HOWEVER, FEW FIELD EXPERIMENTS HAVE EXAMINED HOW EXOTIC PLANTS AFFECT SOIL RESPIRATION VIA LITTER DECOMPOSITION. HERE, WE CONDUCTED AN IN SITU STUDY OF LITTER DECOMPOSITION OF AN ANNUAL NATIVE GRASS (ERAGROSTIS PILOSA), A PERENNIAL EXOTIC FORB (ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES), AND THEIR MIXTURES IN AN ANNUAL GRASSLAND IN CHINA TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL INVASION EFFECTS ON SOIL RESPIRATION. ALTERNANTHERA LITTER DECOMPOSED FASTER THAN ERAGROSTIS LITTER WHEN EACH WAS INCUBATED SEPARATELY. MASS LOSS IN LITTER MIXES WAS MORE RAPID THAN PREDICTED FROM RATES IN SINGLE SPECIES BAGS (ONLY 35% OF PREDICTED MASS REMAINED AT 8 MONTHS) SHOWING SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. NOTABLY, EXOTIC PLANT LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATE WAS UNCHANGED BUT NATIVE PLANT LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATE WAS ACCELERATED IN MIXTURES (DECAY CONSTANT K = 0.20 MONTH(-1)) COMPARED TO IN ISOLATION (K = 0.10 MONTH(-1)). ON AVERAGE, EVERY LITTER TYPE INCREASED SOIL RESPIRATION COMPARED TO BARE SOIL FROM WHICH LITTER WAS REMOVED. HOWEVER, THE INCREASES WERE LARGER FOR MIXED LITTER (1.82 TIMES) THAN FOR ALTERNANTHERA LITTER (1.58 TIMES) OR ERAGROSTIS LITTER (1.30 TIMES). CARBON RELEASED AS CO2 RELATIVE TO LITTER CARBON INPUT WAS ALSO HIGHER FOR MIXED LITTER (3.34) THAN FOR ALTERNATHERA LITTER (2.29) OR ERAGROSTIS LITTER (1.19).

PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPORTANT FOR PROMOTING PLANT INVASIVENESS. HIGH TOLERANCE OF STRESS CAN ALSO INCREASE SURVIVAL OF INVASIVE PLANTS IN ADVERSE HABITATS. LIMITED GROWTH AND CONSERVATION OF CARBOHYDRATE ARE CONSIDERED TO INCREASE TOLERANCE OF FLOODING IN PLANTS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED WHETHER INVASIVE SPECIES SHOWS A HIGHER PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IN RESPONSE TO WATERLOGGING OR A HIGHER TOLERANCE OF WATERLOGGING (LOWER PLASTICITY) THAN NATIVE SPECIES. WE CONDUCTED A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT TO COMPARE THE GROWTH AND MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO WATERLOGGING OF THE INVASIVE, CLONAL, WETLAND SPECIES ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES WITH THOSE OF ITS CO-OCCURRING, NATIVE, CONGENERIC, CLONAL SPECIES ALTERNANTHERA SESSILIS. PLANTS OF A. PHILOXEROIDES AND A. SESSILIS WERE SUBJECTED TO THREE TREATMENTS (CONTROL, 0 AND 60 CM WATERLOGGING). BOTH A. PHILOXEROIDES AND A. SESSILIS SURVIVED ALL TREATMENTS. OVERALL GROWTH WAS LOWER IN A. PHILOXEROIDES THAN IN A. SESSILIS, BUT WATERLOGGING NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE GROWTH OF A. PHILOXEROIDES LESS STRONGLY THAN THAT OF A. SESSILIS. ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES THUS SHOWED LESS SENSITIVITY OF GROWTH TRAITS (LOWER PLASTICITY) AND HIGHER WATERLOGGING TOLERANCE. MOREOVER, THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY OF A.

CLIMATE WARMING MAY IMPACT PLANT INVASION SUCCESS DIRECTLY BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH CHANGES IN THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO TESTS OF HOW CLIMATE WARMING SHIFTS THE INTERACTIONS AMONG INVASIVE PLANTS AND THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES TO AFFECT INVASION SUCCESS. FIELD SURVEYS COVERING THE FULL LATITUDINAL RANGE OF INVASIVE ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES IN CHINA SHOWED THAT A BEETLE INTRODUCED FOR BIOCONTROL WAS RARE OR ABSENT AT HIGHER LATITUDES. IN CONTRAST, PLANT COVER AND MASS INCREASED WITH LATITUDE. IN A 2-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT NEAR THE NORTHERN LIMIT OF BEETLE DISTRIBUTION, WE FOUND THE BEETLE SUSTAINED POPULATIONS ACROSS YEARS UNDER ELEVATED TEMPERATURE, DRAMATICALLY DECREASING A. PHILOXEROIDES GROWTH, BUT IT FAILED TO OVERWINTER IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURE. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WARMING WILL ALLOW THE NATURAL ENEMY TO EXPAND ITS RANGE, POTENTIALLY BENEFITING BIOCONTROL IN REGIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TOO COLD FOR THE NATURAL ENEMY. HOWEVER, THE INVADER MAY ALSO EXPAND ITS RANGE FURTHER NORTH IN RESPONSE TO WARMING. IN SUCH CASES WHERE PLANTS TOLERATE COLD BETTER THAN THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES, THE GEOGRAPHICAL GAP BETWEEN PLANT AND HERBIVOROUS INSECT RANGES MAY NOT DISAPPEAR BUT WILL SHIFT TO HIGHER LATITUDES, LEADING TO A NEW ZONE OF ENEMY RELEASE. THEREFORE, WARMING WILL NOT ONLY AFFECT PLANT INVASIONS DIRECTLY BUT ALSO DRIVE EITHER ENEMY RELEASE OR INCREASE THAT WILL RESULT IN CONTRASTING EFFECTS ON INVASIVE PLANTS.

WHILE MORE THAT 250 INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES WITH NEGATIVE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM CHINA, ONLY A FEW SPECIES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF PAPERS (IN ORDER OF DECREASING NUMBER OF REFERENCES: SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA, AGERATINA ADENOPHORA, MIKANIA MICRANTHA, ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES, SOLIDAGO CANADENSIS, EICHHORNIA CRASSIPES). YET THIS SELECTION MIGHT RATHER REFLECT THE LOCATION OF RESEARCH TEAMS THAN THE MOST INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES IN CHINA. CONSIDERING THE PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN CHINA FOUND IN OUR ANALYSIS RESEARCH IN PLANT INVASIONS COULD BE EXPANDED BY (1) COMPILING COMPREHENSIVE LISTS OF NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES AT THE PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL SCALES AND TO INCLUDE SPECIES THAT ARE NATIVE TO ONE PART OF CHINA BUT NON-NATIVE TO OTHERS IN THESE LISTS; (2) STRENGTHENING PATHWAYS STUDIES (PRIMARY INTRODUCTION TO THE COUNTRY, SECONDARY RELEASES WITHIN THE COUNTRY) TO ENHANCE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT; AND (3) ASSESSING IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES (HABITATS, REGIONS) AND IN RELATION TO CONSERVATION RESOURCES.",ARTICLE,INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES;PLANT INVASIONS;PLANT SPECIES;INVASION SCIENCE;NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES;DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;BIODIVERSITY LOSS;CONSERVATION RESOURCES;INVASIVE SPECIES;RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT;SPATIAL SCALES;NATIONAL SCALE;SPECIES;NEGATIVE IMPACT;PARTS OF CHINA;RECENT DECADES;INVASION;CHINA;ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT;METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH;IMPACT;HANDFUL OF PAPERS;SCALE;PATHWAY STUDIES;DRIVERS;COMPREHENSIVE LIST;NUMBER OF PAPERS;WEB;BROAD RANGE;MANAGEMENT;LIST;RESOURCES;CURRENT STATE;LOCATION;SCIENCE;CHANGES;DECADES;LOSS;SELECTION;MAJOR CAUSE;RESEARCH;ISI WEB;RANGE;HANDFUL;HOT TOPIC;RESEARCH TOPIC;RESEARCH TEAM;KNOWLEDGE;DEVELOPMENT;PART;RELATION;STUDY;TOPIC;APPROACH;NUMBER;STATE;CAUSE;PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS;PAPER;ACHIEVEMENT;PREVENTION;ANALYSIS RESEARCH;TEAM,"CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL,CSC,BEIJING,CHINA",GERMANY;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;GERMANY;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY;SHANDONG UNIVERSITY,DIMENSIONS

THIS MAY REFLECT SHARED RESPONSES TO A COMMON FACTOR, BUT MAY ALSO REFLECT POSITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE EXOTIC SPECIES. ARMAND BAYOU (PASADENA, TX) IS ONE SUCH ECOSYSTEM WHERE MULTIPLE SPECIES OF INVASIVE AQUATIC PLANTS ARE COMMON. WE USED THIS SYSTEM TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER PRESENCE OF ONE EXOTIC SPECIES MADE SUBSEQUENT INVASIONS BY OTHER EXOTIC SPECIES MORE LIKELY, LESS LIKELY, OR IF IT HAD NO EFFECT. WE PERFORMED AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH WE SELECTIVELY REMOVED EXOTIC ROOTED AND/OR FLOATING AQUATIC PLANT SPECIES AND TRACKED SUBSEQUENT COLONIZATION AND GROWTH OF NATIVE AND INVASIVE SPECIES. THIS ALLOWED US TO QUANTIFY HOW PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ONE PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUP INFLUENCED THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL INVASION BY MEMBERS OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONAL GROUP. WE FOUND THAT PRESENCE OF ALLIGATORWEED (ROOTED PLANT) DECREASED ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW WATER HYACINTH (FREE-FLOATING PLANT) PATCHES BUT INCREASED GROWTH OF HYACINTH IN ESTABLISHED PATCHES, WITH AN OVERALL NET POSITIVE EFFECT ON SUCCESS OF WATER HYACINTH. WATER HYACINTH PRESENCE HAD NO EFFECT ON ESTABLISHMENT OF ALLIGATORWEED BUT DECREASED GROWTH OF EXISTING ALLIGATORWEED PATCHES, WITH AN OVERALL NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SUCCESS OF ALLIGATORWEED. MOREOVER, OBSERVATIONAL DATA SHOWED POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN HYACINTH AND ALLIGATORWEED WITH HYACINTH, ON AVERAGE, MORE ABUNDANT. THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF HYACINTH ON ALLIGATORWEED GROWTH IMPLIES COMPETITION, NOT STRONG MUTUAL FACILITATION (INVASIONAL MELTDOWN), IS OCCURRING IN THIS SYSTEM. REMOVAL OF HYACINTH MAY INCREASE ALLIGATORWEED INVASION THROUGH RELEASE FROM COMPETITION. HOWEVER, REMOVAL OF ALLIGATORWEED MAY HAVE MORE COMPLEX EFFECTS ON HYACINTH PATCH DYNAMICS BECAUSE THERE WERE STRONG OPPOSING EFFECTS ON ESTABLISHMENT VERSUS GROWTH.

102,DIFFERENTIAL INFLUENCE OF CLONAL INTEGRATION ON MORPHOLOGICAL AND GROWTH RESPONSES TO LIGHT IN TWO INVASIVE HERBS,"XU, CHENG-YUAN;SCHOOLER, SHON S.;VAN KLINKEN, RIEKS D.",PLOS ONE,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0035873,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: IN CONTRAST TO SEEDS, HIGH SENSITIVITY OF VEGETATIVE FRAGMENTS TO UNFAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENTS MAY LIMIT THE EXPANSION OF CLONAL INVASIVE PLANTS. HOWEVER, CLONAL INTEGRATION PROMOTES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROPAGULES IN LESS SUITABLE HABITATS AND MAY FACILITATE THE EXPANSION OF CLONAL INVADERS INTO INTACT NATIVE COMMUNITIES. HERE, WE EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF CLONAL INTEGRATION ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND GROWTH OF RAMETS IN TWO INVASIVE PLANTS, ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES AND PHYLA CANESCENS, UNDER VARYING LIGHT CONDITIONS.
METHODS: IN A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT, BRANCHES, CONNECTED RAMETS AND SEVERED RAMETS OF THE SAME MOTHER PLANT WERE EXPOSED UNDER FULL SUN AND 85% SHADE AND THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL AND GROWTH RESPONSES WERE ASSESSED.
KEY RESULTS: THE INFLUENCE OF CLONAL INTEGRATION ON THE LIGHT REACTION NORM (CONNECTION×LIGHT INTERACTION) OF DAUGHTER RAMETS WAS SPECIES-SPECIFIC. FOR A. PHILOXEROIDES, CLONAL INTEGRATION EVENED OUT THE LIGHT RESPONSE (TOTAL BIOMASS, LEAF MASS PER AREA, AND STEM NUMBER, DIAMETER AND LENGTH) DISPLAYED IN SEVERED RAMETS, BUT THESE CONNECTION×LIGHT INTERACTIONS WERE LARGELY ABSENT FOR P. CANESCENS. NEVERTHELESS, FOR BOTH SPECIES, CLONAL INTEGRATION OVERWHELMED LIGHT EFFECT IN PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF JUVENILE RAMETS DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT. ALSO, VERTICAL GROWTH, AS AN APPARENT SHADE ACCLIMATION RESPONSE, WAS MORE PREVALENT IN SEVERED RAMETS THAN IN CONNECTED RAMETS. FINALLY, UNROOTED BRANCHES DISPLAYED SMALLER ORGAN SIZE AND SLOWER GROWTH THAN CONNECTED RAMETS, BUT THE PATTERN OF LIGHT REACTION WAS SIMILAR, SUGGESTING MOTHER PLANTS INVEST IN DAUGHTER RAMETS PRIOR TO THEIR OWN BRANCHES.
CONCLUSIONS: CLONAL INTEGRATION MODIFIES LIGHT REACTION NORMS OF MORPHOLOGICAL AND GROWTH TRAITS IN A SPECIES-SPECIFIC MANNER FOR A. PHILOXEROIDES AND P. CANESCENS, BUT IT IMPROVES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF JUVENILE RAMETS OF BOTH SPECIES IN LIGHT-LIMITING ENVIRONMENTS BY PROMOTING THEIR GROWTH DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT.

IF THIS IS DUE TO THE ABILITY OF PLANTS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR ROOTS WHERE NUTRIENT LEVELS ARE HIGH, THEN NUTRIENT HETEROGENEITY SHOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE NO GENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN ROOT PLASTICITY. WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS IN A WIDESPREAD, CLONAL SPECIES IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL PLANTS ARE KNOWN TO RESPOND TO NUTRIENT HETEROGENEITY.
METHODS: PLANTS DERIVED FROM A SINGLE CLONE OF ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES WERE GROWN IN THE GREENHOUSE AT LOW OR HIGH DENSITY (FOUR OR 16 PLANTS PER 27·5 × 27·5-CM CONTAINER) WITH HOMOGENEOUS OR HETEROGENEOUS AVAILABILITY OF SOIL NUTRIENTS, KEEPING TOTAL NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY PER CONTAINER CONSTANT. AFTER 9 WEEKS, MEASUREMENTS OF SIZE, DRY MASS AND MORPHOLOGY WERE TAKEN.
KEY RESULTS: PLANTS GREW MORE IN THE HETEROGENEOUS THAN IN THE HOMOGENEOUS TREATMENT, SHOWING THAT HETEROGENEITY PROMOTED PERFORMANCE; THEY GREW LESS IN THE HIGH- THAN IN THE LOW-DENSITY TREATMENT, SHOWING THAT PLANTS COMPETED. THERE WAS NO INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF NUTRIENT HETEROGENEITY AND PLANT DENSITY, SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HETEROGENEITY DOES NOT AFFECT INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION IN THE ABSENCE OF GENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES IN PLASTICITY. TREATMENTS DID NOT AFFECT MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SPECIFIC LEAF AREA OR ROOT/SHOOT RATIO.
CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT FINE-SCALE, SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE AVAILABILITY OF SOIL NUTRIENTS DOES NOT INCREASE COMPETITION WHEN PLANTS ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL, CONSISTENT WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY ON COMPETITION DEPEND UPON DIFFERENCES IN PLASTICITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.

THIS STUDY OF THE INTRODUCED, INVASIVE, AMPHIBIOUS, STOLONIFEROUS HERB ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES IN CHINA TESTED THE EFFECTS OF FRAGMENT SIZE, OF LOSS OF THE STOLON APEX, AND OF THE ORIGINAL POSITION OF A FRAGMENT WITHIN A CLONE BEFORE FRAGMENTATION ON THE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF FRAGMENTS IN A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT. THE STOLON INTERNODES OF PLANTS CONSISTING OF ONE STOLON WITH 5 RAMETS WERE SEVERED IN ALL 16 POSSIBLE PATTERNS, GENERATING FRAGMENTS OF 15 RAMETS. THESE 16 FRAGMENTATION TREATMENTS WERE CROSSED WITH REMOVAL OF THE STOLON APEX. FRAGMENTATION AND APEX REMOVAL DID NOT AFFECT TOTAL GROWTH OF PLANTS, BUT MORE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED PLANTS PRODUCED SMALLER, MORE NUMEROUS RAMETS. THE SURVIVAL OF FRAGMENTS CONSISTING OF ONE ORIGINAL RAMET WAS ABOUT 85%, COMPARED TO 100% SURVIVAL OF FRAGMENTS WITH 5 ORIGINAL RAMETS. FRAGMENTS CONSISTING OF THE YOUNGEST RAMETS ALONG THE ORIGINAL STOLON GREW MORE THAN FRAGMENTS OF THE SAME SIZE THAT CONSISTED OF OLDER RAMETS. THESE EFFECTS OF FRAGMENTATION ON GROWTH PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE FOR CLONAL INTEGRATION OF THE RATE AT WHICH CONNECTED RAMETS PRODUCE NEW RAMETS AND NOVEL EVIDENCE THAT FRAGMENTS PRODUCED FROM DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF CLONES HAVE DIFFERENT POTENTIAL FOR SPREAD. THEY FURTHER SUGGEST THAT DETACHMENT OF SMALL GROUPS OF DISTAL RAMETS ALONG STOLONS IN THE FIELD MIGHT BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN SPREADING THE SPECIES AND THAT A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE NUMBER AND THE SIZE OF NEW RAMETS PRODUCED BY FRAGMENTS MAY REPRESENT AN ADAPTIVE, PLASTIC RESPONSE TO DISTURBANCE.

ON THE BASIS OF R-ERH, THE PREDICTION OF EICA WILL BE HELD TRUE FOR SLOW-GROWING GENOTYPES, I.E., THE SLOW-GROWING GENOTYPES FROM THE INTRODUCED RANGE WILL BE LESS RESISTANT TO HERBIVORY AND GROW FASTER THAN THOSE FROM THE HOME RANGE; WHILE THE EICA WILL NOT BE HELD FOR FAST-GROWING GENOTYPES, I.E., THERE WILL BE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN GROWTH AND DEFENSE TRAITS BETWEEN THE INTRODUCED AND NATIVE FAST-GROWING GENOTYPES. WE TESTED THESE PREDICTIONS PRELIMINARILY USING FIVE POPULATIONS OF THE INVASIVE PLANT ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES. THIS SPECIES HAS TWO VARIETIES IN ITS HOME RANGE, WHICH SHOWED A DISTINCT GROWTH-DEFENSE STRATEGY: THE NORTHERN A. P. VAR. ACUTIFOLIA (APA) HAD HIGHER GROWTH RATE BUT LOWER RESISTANCE, WHILE THE SOUTHERN A. P. VAR. OBTUSIFOLIA (APO) HAD LOWER GROWTH RATE BUT HIGHER RESISTANCE LEVEL. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE EICA HYPOTHESIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SLOW-GROWING APO, BUT NOT WITH THE FAST-GROWING APA. WE SUGGEST THAT EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN GROWTH OR RESISTANCE FOLLOWING ENEMY RELEASE ARE INFLUENCED BY VARIATION IN GROWTH RATE WITHIN AN INVASIVE ALIEN PLANT.

A RECENTLY IDENTIFIED INVASIVE SPECIES OF APPLE SNAIL, POMACEA INSULARUM, EXHIBITS ALARMING INVASIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH REPRODUCTIVE RATES AND GENERALIST CONSUMPTION PATTERNS. THIS SNAIL TAKES THE OPPOSITE APPROACH TO EGG LAYING COMPARED TO MOST AQUATIC INSECTS AS ADULT SNAILS CRAWL OUT OF THE WATER TO PLACE CLUTCHES ON EMERGENT, OR TERRESTRIAL, SUBSTRATES.

HOWEVER, INTERACTIONS AMONG NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES AND EFFECTS OF THESE INTERACTING DISTURBANCES ON INVASIVE PLANTS AND DESIRED VEGETATION ARE RARELY EXAMINED. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE (HERBICIDAL AND MECHANICAL) ALONG A NATURAL INUNDATION GRADIENT (20282 DAYS) ON THE BIOMASS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION OF THE INVASIVE WETLAND PLANT, ALLIGATOR WEED (ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES), AND TWO CO-OCCURRING COMPETITOR PLANTS, THE INTRODUCED GRASS, KIKUYU (PENNISETUM CLANDESTINUM), AND THE NATIVE GRASS, COUCH (CYNODON DACTYLON), OVER A 2-YEAR PERIOD. IN THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL DISTURBANCE, KIKUYU BIOMASS WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, ALLIGATOR WEED BIOMASS WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED, AND COUCH BIOMASS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY INUNDATION DISTURBANCE. IN ADDITION, KIKUYU WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE SELECTIVE REMOVAL OF ALLIGATOR WEED, WHILE COUCH INCREASED IN WETTER HABITATS WHERE KIKUYU WAS ABSENT DUE TO INUNDATION STRESS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT KIKUYU IS A SUPERIOR COMPETITOR IN DRIER HABITATS AND INUNDATION FACILITATES THE INVASION OF ALLIGATOR WEED, WHILE COUCH IS AN INFERIOR COMPETITOR TO BOTH KIKUYU AND ALLIGATOR WEED AND IS THEREFORE SUPPRESSED ACROSS ITS ENTIRE NICHE BY THESE TWO INTRODUCED SPECIES. MOWING ALONE HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BIOMASS OF THE SPECIES, SUGGESTING THE PLANTS ARE EQUALLY TOLERANT OF SHOOT REMOVAL. SELECTIVE HERBICIDE REDUCED ALLIGATOR WEED BIOMASS BY 97.5% AND THE COMBINATION OF SELECTIVE HERBICIDE AND MOWING REDUCED THE BIOMASS OF ALLIGATOR WEED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN HERBICIDE ALONE, BY 98.6% COMPARED WITH UN-MANIPULATED CONTROLS.

COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ON BIOLOGICAL CONTROL BENEFITS BOTH THE NATIONS BY RECIPROCAL OPPORTUNITIES TO RESEARCH AND EXCHANGE NATURAL ENEMIES, BY EXCHANGING INFORMATION ON COMMON INVASIVE SPECIES, AND BY PROVIDING TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS. HERE WE REVIEW THE HISTORY OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US ON BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF MORE THAN 20 INVASIVE PLANTS. CURRENT COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOUR PLANT SPECIES, POLYGONUM PERFOLIATUM L., TRAPA NATANS L. PUERARIA MONTANA (LOUR.) MERR. VAR. LOBATA AND AILANTHUS ALTISSIMA (MILL.) SWINGLE, ARE ALSO COVERED. WE PRIORITIZE 14 INVASIVE PLANTS AS TARGETS FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIVE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL BASED ON INFORMATION ON THEIR IMPORTANCE IN INTRODUCED AREAS, NATURAL ENEMY RECORDS, AND THEIR POTENTIAL BIOCONTROL RISK TO INTRODUCED ECOSYSTEMS. THEY ARE: AMPELOPSIS BREVIPENDUNCULATA, CELASTRUS ORBICULATUS, DIOSCOREA OPPOSITIFOLIA, EUONYMUS ALATA, EUONYMUS FORTUNEI, LIGUSTRUM SINENSE, MELIA AZEDARACH, PAULOWNIA TOMENTOSA, SAPIUM SEBIFERUM AND ULMUS PUMILA FOR THE US, AS WELL AS SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA, AMBROSIA ARTEMISIIFOLIA, AMBROSIA TRIFIDA AND SOLIDAGO CANADENSIS FOR CHINA. IN ADDITION, WE EMPHASIZE THAT WE MUST VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY POTENTIAL NON-TARGET EFFECT WHEN WE INTEND TO INTRODUCE AND RELEASE NEW NATURAL ENEMIES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE HIGH PRIORITY BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE PLACED ON CONTROL OF INVASIVE PLANTS WILL STIMULATE INCREASING COLLABORATION ON BIOLOGICAL CONTROL.",ARTICLE,INVASIVE PLANTS;NATURAL ENEMIES;BIOLOGICAL CONTROL;PLANT SPECIES;HOST-SPECIFIC NATURAL ENEMIES;POTENTIAL NON-TARGET EFFECTS;INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES;COMMON INVASIVE SPECIES;CLASSICAL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL;NEW NATURAL ENEMIES;NON-TARGET EFFECTS;AILANTHUS ALTISSIMA (MILL.)

GRIESB) WAS SURVEYED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PHENOLOGY/CARBOHYDRATE RELATIONSHIPS FOR IMPROVING CONTROL TACTICS. MANY STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED PHENOLOGY OF WATERHYACINTH, HYDRILLA, AND EURASIAN WATERMILFOIL, BUT NOT ALLIGATORWEED. PHENOLOGY OF MONOECIOUS AND DIOECIOUS BIOTYPES OF HYDRILLA DIFFERS IN GROWTH PATTERN AND PROPAGULE DEVELOPMENT. THE MONOECIOUS BIOTYPE APPEARS TO BE BETTER ADAPTED THAN THE DIOECIOUS BIOTYPE TO LIVE AT NORTHERN LATITUDES BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO PRODUCE MORE TUBERS AND TURIONS AT LOWER WATER TEMPERATURES. A FEW INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING EURASIAN WATERMILFOIL AND ALLIGATORWEED SUGGESTED THAT CONTROL EFFORTS DIRECTED AT THE LOW EBB OF CARBOHYDRATES WILL DECREASE BIOMASS PRODUCTION. LITTLE INFORMATION ON CARBOHYDRATE PARTITIONING HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR WATERHYACINTH AND HYDRILLA. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THESE PLANTS HAVE NOT EVALUATED THE ROLE OF STARCH RESERVES FOR PLANT SURVIVAL. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS (E.G., TEMPERATURE, LIGHT, AND NUTRIENTS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INFLUENCE PHENOLOGY AND, BY INFERENCE, CARBOHYDRATE PARTITIONING. HOW THESE FACTORS CONTROL CARBOHYDRATE PARTITIONING IN THESE PLANTS IS UNKNOWN.
