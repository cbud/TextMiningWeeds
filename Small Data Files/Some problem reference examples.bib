Bindweed is native to the Mediterranean region of the Old World, where it and a morphologically similar species, scammony (C. scammonia), are both still used medicinally. Although the first literature on C. arvensis referred to its medicinal uses, it was also dispersed as an ornamental and by accident. Herbarium vouchers and literature were used to map the first occurrences of C. arvensis in each state of the USA. Bindweed was first reported in North America (Virginia) in the 1730s, and was sold commercially by mail in and from Pennsylvania by 1807. Over the decades, the reputation as a medicinal plant became lost. It was not until the 1880s that C. arvensis came to be considered a naturalized weed in North America, but efforts to eliminate this twining herb were not made until the early 1900s. Almost 100 years of battling this medicinal turned pest have failed to effectively control the species.},

   abstract = {Italian ryegrass (Lolium perenne spp. multiflorum Lam.) is a troublesome weed commonly found in winter cereals. Winter cover crops represent an alternative for weed suppression, reducing weed soil seed banks, and future infestations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suppression of winter cover crops on reducing the soil seed bank and infestations of Italian ryegrass in fields managed under no-tillage system. Field experiment was carried out during three consecutive years, in a strip-plot design with four blocks, containing the winter cover crops. Wheat (Triticum aestivum), canola (Brassica napus), barley (Hordeum vulgare), common vetch (Vicia sativa), cereal rye (Secale cereale), feral radish (Raphanus sativus), and black oat (Avena strigosa) were sown in each strip (block) under no-tillage system and compared with weedy fallow. Seed bank was quantified at 0.0- to 0.05- and 0.05- to 0.10-m depths, whereas Italian ryegrass infestations were measured with a sample frame of 0.0625 m(2). Greater suppression and lower soil seed bank were reported in plots managed with cereal rye, common vetch, black oat, and feral radish, reducing up to 80% in the first year, and up to 96% after 3 yr of continuous management in comparison to weedy fallow. Italian ryegrass infestations increased four- to six-fold when managed with canola. High suppressor potential of Italian ryegrass occurred for cover crops with biomass dry accumulation greater than 8.7 tons ha(-1), especially to plants with a height upper to 1 m, plant characteristics essential to reduce strongly Italian ryegrass infestations and ensure weed-free fields throughout the time.},

   abstract = {This abstract is based on this report and 28th & 29th Ann. Repts. (1920-21 & 1921-22), Montana Agric. Expt. Sta. (1922 and 1923) pp. 49-55 & 21-22.] The infestation of grasshoppers in Montana in 1921 was very serious, the most injurious species being the same as in the previous year [R.A.E., A, ix, 585], and maps are given showing their distribution. There was a particularly sudden increase of Melanoplus bivittatus, Say, in the Yellowstone valley, which, together with the occurrence of M. atlantis, Riley, necessitated organized campaigns. In all, more than 700, 000 acres of infested land in Montana were treated, the saving of crop being estimated at over Pound Sterling500, 000, at a cost of approximately Pound Sterling37, 000 for materials. The loss to wheat 'and other crops from Porosagrotis orthogonia[Agrotis orthogonia], Morr. (pale western cutworm) has much diminished, probably owing in large measure to heavy snowstorms destroying many adults, better moisture conditions, and greater prevalence of natural enemies. Further investigations have not revealed any direct method of destroying the cutworms. Summer fallowed ground, not worked at all between 15th July and 15th September, and ploughed early, is generally the least affected. In some years early spring ploughing will prove as effective as summer fallow. No cultivation practices are of value where winter wheat is grown, except when the wheat is sown after 15th September. Infested fields that can be irrigated should receive the water as early as possible. Other pests included the blister mite [Eriophyes pyri, Pgst.], which caused heavy losses in apple orchards in 1921, but was much less injurious in 1922, owing to the use of lime-sulphur or miscible oil; Calandra granaria[Sitophilus granarius], L., and Laemophloeus pusillus[Cryptolestes pusillus], Schon., in granaries; the thrips, Frankliniella tritici, Fitch, which damages lucerne seed and interferes with the production of honey; grasshoppers, including Anabrus simplex, Hald. (Mormon cricket), which seems to have appeared in Montana for the first time; Nysius ericae, Schul., in ears of maize; Eriosoma (Schizoneura) americanum, Riley (elm gall louse), occurring wherever elm is an important shade tree; Brevicoryne brassicae, L. (cabbage aphis), which was noticeably more abundant than in 1920; the cutworms, Euxoa ochrogaster, Gn., E. tristicula, Morr., which occurred on Russian thistle (Salsola pestifer) early in the season, E. pallipennis, Sm., found in 1922 on S. pestifer, but not recorded from any other food-plant, Agrotis unicolor, Wlk. (Noctua clandestina, Harr.), feeding mostly on garden vegetables and some grasses, and Agrotis havilae, Grote, and Euxoa (A.) c-nigrum, L., on prairie land; other Lepidoptera, including Schizura concinna, A. & S. (red-humped apple caterpillar), the larvae of which damaged apple foliage; Loxostege sticiicalis, L. (sugar-beet webworm), less abundant than in recent years; Pieris (Pontia) rapae (imported cabbage worm), more injurious than usual; Marumba modesta, Harr, (poplar sphinx moth); and Tortrix (Archips) rosaceana, Harr. (oblique-banded leaf-roller), causing considerable injury; the Diptera, Hylemyia terealis, Gill, (western wheat stem maggot), which caused a total loss of crop over thousands of acres; Rhagoletis cingulata, Loew, and R. fausta, O.S. (cherry maggots); Meromyza americana, Fitch (greater wheat stem maggot); Straussia longipennts, Wied. (sunflower maggot), which bores through the pith, leaves the plant a few inches below the head, falls to the ground and pupates during the winter; and Epochra canadensis, Loew (currant fruit-fly), which is the chief pest of currants in Montana; the Coleoptera, Aphodius inquinatus, Hbst. (dung beetle), the adults of which were said to feed on newly sown wheat, though the larvae apparently caused no damage; Zettgophora scutellaris, Suff. {cottonwood leaf-miner); the flea-beetles, Epitrix subcrinita, Lee., Phyllotreta albionica, Lec., Psylloides punctulaia, Melsh., and Disonycha triangularis, Say, on garden vegetables; the blister beetles, Epicauta maculata, Say, and Cantharis (Lytta) nuttalli, Say, living on grasshopper eggs and injuring lucerne and vegetable crops; Conotrachelus nenuphar, Hrbst. (plum curculio), found occasionally on apple; and Baris carbonaria, Blatchley, a new pest on strawberries. Pests recorded in 1922 and not noted above include Melanoplus brunen, Scudd., recorded for the first time in Montana, Acyrthosiphon (Illinoia) pisi, Kalt, (pea aphis), attacking lucerne, but almost exterminated by Coccinellids; Chorizagrotis auxiliaris[Euxoa auxiliaris], Grote (army cutworm), in grain fields; Cirphis unipuncta[Mythimna unipuncta], Haw. (army worm); Malacosoma fragilis, Stretch (western tent caterpillar), and M. disstria, Hb. ; and Haltica bimarginata, Say (alder flea-beetle). Beneficial insects included Sarcophaga kellyi, Aldr. (flesh fly), parasitic on grasshoppers, and Calosoma calidum, F. (fiery ground beetle), predacious on Porosagrotis orihogonia. During 1921 the insect pest law was passed, empowering county commissioners to appoint an officer to supervise the control of any dangerous insect pest and to levy a general tax for necessary supplies.},

   abstract = {Aspidiotus perniciosus [Diaspidiotus perniciosus], Comst. (San Jose scale) occurs in the southern and western parts of the State, attacking many trees and shrubs. Lepidosaphes ulmi, L. (oyster-shell scale) is found in every fruit growing area. The time of hatching of the eggs varies from the end of May to the middle of June. Chionaspis furfura, Fitch (scurfy scale) is present, but hitherto has caused little damage. The young scales appear at the end of May or the beginning in June. Both this and the preceding species can be controlled by spraying with Black Leaf 40, lime-sulphur, or miscible oil at the time of hatching. Aspidiotus ostreaeformis, Curt. (European fruit scale) attacks the same hosts as A. perniciosus, but with less serious results. Pulvinaria vitis, L. (cottony maple scale) hibernate in the adult stage. Eggs are deposited in May or June, and the young upon hatching, settle on the leaves and twigs of the host. A spray consisting of Black Leaf 40 or kerosene emulsion should be applied when the young first appear. Eulecanium (Lecanium) corni, Bch., occurs throughout the State. Lime-sulphur at 5 degrees Be. should be used against it as a winter spray and Black Leaf 40 or kerosene emulsion at the time of hatching. Cydia (Carpocapsa) pomonella, L. (codling moth) is one of the most serious pests of apples. The life-history is given in detail. The first spray, consisting of lead arsenate (2 Ib. paste or 1 Ib. powder to 50 U.S. gals, water) should be applied when from 80 to 90 per cent. of the petals have fallen, the second three weeks later, and a third, if necessary, two or three weeks after the second. The third application will be given about the middle of July in the south and the beginning of August in the north. Archips argyrospilus, Walk, (fruit-tree leaf-roller) has recently appeared in Idaho, but at present has caused little damage. The eggs, which are laid in June and July, hatch in April or May of the following year. The larvae feed within the webbed leaves for two or three weeks, then pupate; adults emerge after about 10 days. Lead arsenate spray as used for the codling moth is effective, also miscible oil or kerosene emulsion used as a dormant spray. Eucosma (Tmetocera) ocellana, Schiff, (bud-moth) hibernates as an immature larva and adults appear in June and July. Eggs deposited on the leaves hatch in one or two weeks. Xylina sp. (green fruit worm) often causes serious damage to orchard trees. Malacosoma disstria, Hb., and M. pluvialis, Dyar (tent caterpillars), are common on forest trees throughout the State. They may be controlled by lead arsenate spray, using 3 Ib. paste to 50 gals. water, or by destruction of the larval nests. Schizura concinna, 3. and A. (red-humped caterpillar) appears in the adult stage in June and July. The larvae hatching in July and August feed on the terminal leaves of the branches until mature, then pupate under leaves, etc., on the ground. The winter is passed in the pupal stage. Datana ministra, Drury (yellow-necked caterpillar) occurs on fruit trees in some areas. Cacoecia (Archips) cerasivorana, Fitch (cherry-tree tortrix) occurs on wild cherry and occasionally in orchards during June and July. Hyphantria cunea, Drury (fall web-worm) feeds in autumn within the webbed leaves of the host; adults emerge in June and July. Orgyia (Notolophus) antiqua, L. (vaporiser moth) may cause injury in both northern and southern parts of the State. For the control of this species, the removal of egg-masses in winter or early spring and spraying with arsenicals when larvae first appear are recommended. Eriocampoides limacina (Caliroa cerasi) (pear and cherry slug), can be destroyed by spraying with hellebore at the rate of 1 Ib. to 50 gals. water. If lead arsenate is used, it must be applied early, either before or immediately after hatching. Eriophyes pyri, Pagst. (pear leaf blister mite), Bryobia pratensis[Bryobia praetiosa], Garm. (brown mite), and Tetranychus bimaculatus[Tetranychus urticae], Harv. (red spider), can be controlled with lime-sulphur sprays. The most common Aphid present are Aphis pomi, A. sorbi, A. pruni, Myzus cerasi, M. persicae and Eriosoma (Schizoneura) lanigerum. The most important pests of peaches are Anarsia lineatella, Zell., and Aegeria (Sanninoidea) exitiosa, Say. In the former hibernation occurs in the immature larval stage under the bark; there are several generations annually. In the latter species eggs are laid in midsummer on the trunk near the base of the tree; hibernation takes place in the larval stage in the trunk or roots. Apricot, apple and cherry are also attacked by this species. Oecanthus niveus, de Geer (snowy tree cricket) may cause damage to prune orchards in southern Idaho. Arsenical sprays will aid in controlling this species. Cicada tibicen often occurs in orchards which are situated near large bodies of timber. Ceresa bubalus, F. (buffalo tree-hopper) is common in southern Idaho, and in the north has recently injured young trees. It can be controlled by the destruction of twigs containing eggs and by clean cultivation. Empoasca mali, le B. (apple leaf-hopper) is common on young apple trees throughout the State; kerosene emulsion or Black Leaf 40 are effective sprays against this insect. The most important garden pests are Leptinotarsa 10-lineata, Say (Colorado potato beetle), Epitrix cucumeris, Harris (potato flea-beetle), Pieris (Pontia) rapae, L. (cabbage worm), Aphis brassicae[Brevicoryne brassicae], L. (cabbage aphis), Protoparce (Phlegethontius) sexta, Joh. (tomato worm), cutworms, Bruchus pisorum, L. (pea weevil), Aphis gossypii, Glover (melon aphis), Chlorides, (Heliothis) obsoleta, F. (corn-ear worm), Thrips tabaci, Lind, (onion thrips), and Chortophila (Phorbia) rubivora, Coq. (raspberry cane maggot). Formulae for the preparation of the more common spraying materials are given.},

   abstract = {Rigorous cost-effective census methods are an essential part of managing wild animal populations, particularly if the involved species require continuous monitoring. In recent years, the range and size of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) population have increased notably as a result of conservation programs. Given this expansive scenario, monitoring Iberian lynx using camera-traps may become logistically and financially unfeasible. Here, we test whether or not scat counts are as efficient as camera-trapping in predicting lynx densities and compare the cost of these two approaches to lynx monitoring. We found a significant positive linear relationship between these two methods of assessing Iberian lynx abundance. Lynx abundance assessment by scat counting was six times less expensive than camera-trapping; there was no significant effect of the two study areas on the observed patterns (GLM F-1,F-7 = 45.81, P < 0.001). Our study shows that scat counting is a non-invasive cost-effective method that can provide reliable assessments of Iberian lynx abundance. However, if comparisons are to be made, censuses should be carried out (a) under as nearly identical conditions as possible and (b) in the same season. A number of different factors affect scat abundance, and in order to improve counts, it would be of great interest to evaluate the potential effect of the factors that cause scat estimates to vary.},

Cereal rye biomass production at the time of crop planting ranged from 290-1,480 kg ha(-1). Overall, no-till management with a cover crop reduced weed density by 31% and reduced weed biomass by 61% compared with no-till without a cover crop. These results indicate that the use of a cereal rye cover crop in the Upper Midwest has potential to reduce the exclusive reliance on spring burndown herbicides in no-till, but limited spring cover crop biomass in this region may diminish the weed-suppressive effects from this management practice compared with other parts of the United States where higher amounts of cover crop biomass can be achieved at crop planting time.},

Among the chief pests are Loxostege sticticalis, L. (sugar-beet webworm), which, however, is generally kept in check by parasites; Pemphigus betae, Doane (sugar-beet root aphis); Pegomyia hyoscyami, Panz. (beet-leaf miner); Tetanops aldrichi[Tetanops myopaeformis], Hendel (sugar-beet root-maggot) [R.A.E., A, xi, 78], which caused very little damage in 1922, the ground being so hot and dry that many of the eggs laid on it shrivelled without hatching; Hulstea undulatella, Clem, (sugar-beet crown borer), which destroyed as much as 50 per cent. of some crops, the larva working on the crown of the beet and either cutting off the top or injuring it so that it did not develop; Entettix tenella, Baker (beet leaf-hopper), which was more than usually injurious during the summer of 1922; the alfalfa weevil [Hypera variabilis[Hypera postica], Hbst.] and Enrymus euryiheme, Boisd. (alfalfa caterpillar), which were minor pests, though the latter caused considerable loss by feeding on the skins of water melons; and Bmchophagus funebris, How. (clover seed Chalcid), which was very destructive to lucerne grown for seed. The outstanding features of 1922 have been a heavy infestation of corn ear-worm [Heliothis obsoleta, F.] in both field and sweet maize in the late summer, and the destruction of newly planted apple orchards by the tree-hopper, Stictocephala festina[Spissistilus festinus], Say, especially in the vicinity of lucerne or sweet clover. Grasshoppers, and the black or mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex, Hald.) have both been more than usually abundant.},

   abstract = {Cover crops can be utilized to suppress weeds via direct competition for sunlight, water, and soil nutrients. Research was conducted to determine if cover crops can be used in label-mandated buffer areas in 2,4-D-resistant soybean cropping systems. Delaying termination of cover crops containing cereal rye to at or after soybean planting resulted in a 25 to more than 200 percentage point increase in cover crop biomass compared to a control treatment. Cover crops generally improved horseweed control when 2,4-D was not used. Cover crops reduced grass densities up to 54% at four of six site-years when termination was delayed to after soybean planting. Cover crops did not reduce giant ragweed densities. Cover crops reduced waterhemp densities by up to 45%. Cover crops terminated at or after planting were beneficial within buffer areas for control of grasses and waterhemp, but not giant ragweed. Yield reductions of 14% to 41% occurred when cover crop termination was delayed to after soybean planting at three of six site-years. Terminating the cover crops at planting time provided suppression of grasses and waterhemp within buffer areas and had similar yield to the highest-yielding treatment in five out of six site-years. © The Author(s), 2021.

   abstract = {These notes are taken from the general report of Mr. H. W. B. Moore on insect pests during 1916, as in previous years [see this Review, Ser. A, ii, p. 57, v, p. 148], and includes an account of a new small moth-borer of sugar-cane belonging to the family PYRALIDAE. It is widely distributed, but appears to have more or less definite times for appearing. Its method of attack differs from that of other small borers, in that it bores straight to the growing-point or heart and then eats out a small cavity, instead of making a longitudinal tunnel. The entrance hole is circular and very small, and the boring has some resemblance to an incipient attack by Diatraea saccharalis. The caterpillar pupates outside the boring, in a slight whitish cocoon. The small moth-borers, Diatraea sacckaralis and D. canella, are still doing serious damage and further control work in the early stages of the sugar-cane is necessary, by taking parasitized egg-clusters from canes about to be cut, and distributing them in young fields. Control work against the large moth-borer, Castnia licus[Castniomera licus], is very uneven, the collection of caterpillars and moths having been neglected on many estates. The small black hard-back, Dyscinetus bidetitatus, caused serious damage on two estates, though it was reduced by a systematic collection of the beetles, which destroy the young cane-shoots and often bore into the base of the plant. A closely related species, D. barbatus, occurs in Antigua, St. Kitts, and Barbuda. The Scoliid wasp, Tiphia parallela, was found to be a parasite of D. bidentatus in British Guiana. There was a severe outbreak of this pest on one estate, where over 4, 000, 000 adults and nymphs were destroyed during the season by sweeping the drains in the worst-infested fields with wide-mouthed nets. The eggs of this pest were found to be deposited in dry grass or cane-blades or between dry cane-blades and the earth. The grass looper, Pelamia (Mods) repanda, attacked the blades of young canes on several estates; these outbreaks seem to occur annually after the mid-year rains, while in some of the West Indian islands they are experienced only at long Intervals, probably because the pest is kept in check by its natural enemies. In these islands the insect is known as the Guinea grass moth or Guinea grass worm, but the caterpillars are very fond 'of Para grass, and occasionally attack other grasses. The rice worm (Laphygma fntgiperda), known as the corn-ear worm in the West Indies, and the fall army worm in the United States, did a small amount of damage to sugar-cane in British Guiana.},

   abstract = {Conservation agriculture has been marketed to producers as a sustainable way to increase soil productivity and buffer the effects of anticipated fluctuations in both climate and the price of fuel and fertilizer. Despite US Farm Bill financial incentives promoting the use of conservation practices such as no-tillage and cover crops among producers, widescale adoption of cover crops in the US remains low. Implementing no-tillage and cover crop use may take years of consistent management to show measurable soil quality improvement. Conversely, costs associated with cover crop planting and management must be incurred immediately and before the accrual of any benefits. Current research has largely focused on the soil quality benefits of cover crops without considering the short-term implementation costs for producers comparing their current production systems to conservation systems they may adopt. To help fill this knowledge gap, soil properties, cash crop yield, and annual production costs were evaluated in a three-year maize /soybean study comparing a conservation system to a conventional production system in Mississippi from 2016 to 2018. The conventional system included frequent tillage and control of winter weeds with a residual soil herbicide (conv. till + bare). We compared five different levels of conservation systems, including a conservation system with no-tillage and cover crops (no-till + cover). We found a lack of consistent improvement in soil properties such as soil organic matter increase or crop yield in the conservation system over the three-year period. The economic benefits of substituting no-tillage and cover crops for expensive conventional inputs were much greater than the modest soil property improvements observed from 2016 to 2018 crops. Though crop yields varied, the cost of cash crop production in the conservation system (no till + cover) was 43% less than the cost of the conventional system ($29.67 per Mg of crop yield in the conv. till + bare to $17.04 per Mg of crop yield in the no-till + cover system), highlighting a short-term economic incentive for producers to switch to conservation agriculture. The greatest resource benefit from the conservation system was a reduction in estimated soil loss, as mean soil loss in no-till and cover crop decreased by 86% compared to the conventional system (3.5-25.1 t ha(-1)). These results demonstrate that conservation agriculture has the potential to decrease overall production cost while decreasing the risk of accelerated soil erosion during expected weather extremes associated with climate change, potentially making both farming operations and agro-ecosystems more resilient.},

Other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were unaffected. Coadministration of St. John's wort significantly increased S-warfarin CL/F, whereas treatment with Asian ginseng produced only a moderate increase in CL/F. G. biloba and ginger did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy subjects. None of the herbs studied had a direct effect on warfarin pharmacodynamics.

   abstract = {An account is given of experiments carried out at Zagreb in 1950-55 to study the effects of different food-plants on the population dynamics of four polyphagous Lepidoptera that are pests of deciduous trees in Yugoslavia. Most of them concerned Lymantria dispar (L.), outbreaks of which occur frequently in forests in certain parts of the country. Field-collected egg-masses of this species on oak (Quercus robur (pedunculata)) were transferred to the laboratory in early 1950, and the larvae were reared on leafy twigs of oak (Q. robur or Q. sessiliflora), hornbeam, beech, apple or plum. The cultures on Q. robur maintained themselves throughout the six years, though mortality was fairly high and reached 98 and 99 per cent. in 1951 and 1955, respectively, those on Q. sessiliflora died out in 1955, and those on the other trees died out almost every year, so that eggs had to be introduced from the cultures on oak. The food-plant affected the duration of development, that of males ranging from 79 days on beech to 70 days on Q. robur and that of females from 81 days on apple to 68 days on hornbeam, with some variation according to the origin of the cultures. Females usually had five moults, but some had four or six, and males reared on Q. sessiliflora or beech also had five, all others having only four. Outbreaks on Q. robur in forests usually last 4-5 years and those on beech 2-3, and that their duration is affected by the food-plant was confirmed in a test in which larvae from the coastal area, where Q. ilex is the main food-plant, showed 26 per cent. mortality on this tree, 60 per cent. on bitter cherry, 83 and 86 per cent. on Ostrya carpinifolia and Q. cerris, and 98 per cent. or more on Q. sessiliflora, Q. robur, hornbeam, beech, apple and plum. Some of the mortality in the main tests was caused by polyhedral disease, which is considered to be present in all populations of L. dispar. There was an outbreak of it in 1951, but whereas it did not cause complete mortality of the larvae on oak, it did so on all the other plants. Mortality due to this disease usually becomes high during the later stages of an outbreak of L. dispar, and the influence of the less favourable food-plants on it is held to be exercised through their contribution to the general physiological weakening of the insect population. Other diseases are favoured in like manner. Outbreaks of L. dispar can thus persist only on the most favoured food-plants, which appear to be Q. robur in the lowlands of Croatia, Q. ilex in the coastal area and Q. coccifera in Macedonia. There may be still other local races or ecotypes. The tests with the other insects were less detailed. Malacosoma neustria (L.) is mainly a pest of fruit trees but also infests oaks. Cultures originating from fruit trees throve on leaves of the same species in the laboratory, and transfer of eggs or young larvae from Q. ilex to a mixture of leaves of Q. ilex or fruit trees had no ill effects. Euproctis similis (Fuessly) (chrysorrhoea, auct.) is a pest of oaks, fruit trees and Arbutus unedo. The rearing tests showed little difference in the suitability of leaves from these trees, but mortality was rather high and fewer eggs were laid when individuals from A. unedo or plum were transferred to pear. The introduced Hyphantria cunea (Dru.) is highly polyphagous. In 1953, three generations were reared on mulberry, plum, cherry, apple, walnut and hornbeam, two on lilac and one on oak, and the reproductive potential was highest on the first two and (in the first generation) on hornbeam. Not more than two generations developed in 1954, and reproduction was again greatest on mulberry and plum. Climate is therefore held to be of equal importance with food-plants in the occurrence of outbreaks of this insect.},

   volume = {2},
   number = {45},
   abstract = {Background: This paper is based on ethnobotanical interviews conducted from 1996-2000 in Trinidad and Tobago with thirty male and female respondents. Methods: A non-experimental validation was conducted on the plants used for urinary problems and diabetes mellitus: This is a preliminary step to establish that the plants used are safe or effective, to help direct clinical trials, and to inform Caribbean physicians of the plants' known properties to avoid counter-prescribing. Results: The following plants are used to treat diabetes: Antigonon leptopus, Bidens alba, Bidens pilosa, Bixa orellana, Bontia daphnoides, Carica papaya, Catharanthus roseus, Cocos nucifera, Gomphrena globosa, Laportea aestuans, Momordica charantia, Morus alba, Phyllanthus urinaria and Spiranthes acaulis. Apium graviolens is used as a heart tonic and for low blood pressure. Bixa orellana, Bontia daphnoides, Cuscuta americana and Gomphrena globosa are used for jaundice. The following plants are used for hypertension: Aloe vera, Annona muricata, Artocarpus altilis, Bixa orellana, Bidens alba, Bidens pilosa, Bonta daphnoides, Carica papaya, Cecropia peltata, Citrus paradisi, Cola nitida, Crescentia cujete, Gomphrena globosa, Hibiscus sabdariffa, Kalanchoe pinnata, Morus alba, Nopalea cochinellifera, Ocimum campechianum, Passiflora quadrangularis, Persea americana and Tamarindus indicus. The plants used for kidney problems are Theobroma cacao, Chamaesyce hirta, Flemingia strobilifera, Peperomia rotundifolia, Petiveria alliacea, Nopalea cochinellifera, Apium graveolens, Cynodon dactylon, Eleusine indica, Gomphrena globosa, Pityrogramma calomelanos and Vetiveria zizanioides. Plants are also used for gall stones and for cooling. Conclusion: Chamaesyce hirta, Cissus verticillata, Kalanchoe pinnata, Peperomia spp., Portulaca oleraceae, Scoparia dulcis, and Zea mays have sufficient evidence to support their traditional use for urinary problems, "cooling" and high cholesterol. Eggplant extract as a hypocholesterolemic agent has some support but needs more study. The plants used for hypertension, jaundice and diabetes that may be safe and justify more formal evaluation are Annona squamosa, Aloe vera, Apium graveolens, Bidens alba, Carica papaya, Catharanthus roseus, Cecropia peltata, Citrus paradisi, Hibsicus sabdariffa, Momordica charantia, Morus alba, Persea americana, Phyllanthus urinaria, Tamarindus indicus and Tournefortia hirsutissima. Several of the plants are used for more than one condition and further trials should take this into account.},

Unraveling the domestication history of rye will extend our understanding of crop evolution and upend our inherent understanding of agricultural weeds. To this end, in this study we generated the 8.5 Tb of whole-genome resequencing data from 116 worldwide accessions of wild, weedy, and cultivated rye, and demonstrated that cultivated rye was domesticated directly from weedy relatives with a similar but enhanced genomic selection by humans. We found that a repertoire of genes that experienced artificial selection is associated with important agronomic traits, including shattering, grain yield, and disease resistance. Furthermore, we identified a composite introgression in cultivated rye from the wild perennial Secale strictum and detected a 2-Mb introgressed fragment containing a candidate ammonium transporter gene with potential effect on the grain yield and plant growth of rye. Taken together, our findings unravel the domestication history of cultivated rye, suggest that interspecific introgression serves as one of the likely causes of obscure species taxonomy of the genus Secale, and provide an important resource for future rye and wheat breeding. © 2021 The Author},

   abstract = {A formula is given for a lime-sulphur spray against San Jose scale (Aspidiotus perniciosus[Diaspidiotus perniciosus]), and for terrapin scale, (Lecanium nigrofasciatum), a standard miscible oil at a strength of 1: 15, applied to the tree as late in the spring as possible, is recommended. The woolly apple aphis (Eriosoma lanigerum) is stated to be very common in apple orchards, and of numerous remedies tried, 10 per cent. kerosene emulsion seems to be the most effective against this and other aphids. The loss caused by Hessian Fly (Mayetiola destructor) is periodic, but has increased during the last two years in Maryland. When wheat is infested in winter or early spring it is best to pasture sheep in the field, that they may eat the wheat down to the roots. As the insect passes the summer in the wheat stubble, this should be burned over or ploughed under as soon as possible after harvest. Rotation of crops is very beneficial. A list of cities and towns is given and dates before which wheat should not be sown in these places. In 1912, alfalfa, corn, millet, lawns and other crops or plants in their vicinity were seriously damaged by the fall army worm (Laphygma frugiperda[Spodoptera frugiperda]). The larvae can be controlled by the use of poisoned bait spread over the infested area. The pickle worm (Diaphania nitidalis) also caused considerable damage to cucumbers, melons, and early and late squashes and pumpkins in 1912. The moth deposits her eggs in the blossoms and the larvae enter the young fruits, where they live until mature. A trap crop, coming into blossom before the main crop, is a valuable method of collecting the eggs and larvae. All rubbish after the crop is taken should be burned. Widespread injury has been done to black locust trees, especially along the Potomac River, by the locust Hispid (Chalepus dorsalis). The larvae of this insect feed between the two surfaces of the leaf, where they also pupate. A poison spray of 4 lb. arsenate of lead to 50 gals water was very effective, and the use of soap in the spray was found to make the solution adhere to the foliage better. Burning over the wood lots in late autumn may prove beneficial. The orange-striped oak worm (Anisota senatoria) has caused considerable defoliation of the pin-oaks, and severe injury in some nurseries. Two pounds of arsenate of lead to fifty gallons of water used as a spray will control the pest.},

   abstract = {The author points out the danger which exists in those districts in which this vegetable is cultivated on a large scale of an extraordinary invasion of Vanessa cardui[Cynthia cardui] and also of a Noctuid, which he believes to be Xanthoecia flavago, Schiff. The caterpillars of the former live entirely upon the parenchyma of the leaves on the upper surface. It has been remarked that everywhere where the artichoke leaves have not sufficed for the food of the swarms of larvae they have migrated to cardoons. The swarms make their appearance about the time when the growth of the artichoke plants is complete in the South of France, and the damage consists in stripping the leaves and preventing the maturation of the heads. Spraying and dusting with insecticides appear to be absolutely without effect. Arsenical sprays have not been used and the growers have been driven to cutting off the attacked leaves and burning them. M. Benard of the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle has examined a large number of pupae of Vanessa collected from artichoke gardens and has discovered that almost everyone is parasitized by a Chalcid. Unfortunately this is not the case with the second pest above-mentioned, which has become exceedingly serious because it attacks, in the late season of growth, the stems which support the artichokes and the artichokes themselves. The period of fruiting of the artichoke coincides with the development of this Noctuid, the larva of which, beginning in the axil of the leaves, bores into the stem and eats out the pith, so finding its way into the interior of the flower. Its attack is occasionally made also either from within or from without upon the capitulum or the bracts. The life-history of this pest has not yet been properly studied, and the author says that the only method at present of dealing with it is to examine the plants carefully and to burn any branches which appear to be attacked.},

   abstract = {A severe outbreak of Alabama argillacea occurred all over the Southern States and the adult moths reached as far north as New York, Massachusetts, and even Canada. The cotton over the whole cotton-growing region was almost entirely defoliated. The bean leaf-roller (Eudamus proteus) was abundant and destructive, as also was the velvet bean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatilis). The pumpkin bug (Nezara hilaris[Acrosternum hilare]) was troublesome during the autumn and caused severe damage in some orange groves. Icerya purchasi has been found in Tampa and specimens were received from Arcadia, Knights and Haines City. This is the first occurrence of this pest outside of the St. Petersburg sub-peninsula; it appears to be slowly spreading, but has not yet produced any severe outbreak. The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) reached Florida in the autumn of 1911; specimens were received from Escambia County and it was reported from Santa Rosa County. The fall army-worm (Laphygma frugiperda[Spodoptera frugiperda]) was reported as being very serious in Gadsden and Walton Counties. The melon and pickle worms (Diaphania hyalinata and D. nitidalis) did a large amount of damage in Alachua County and in other parts of the State. Corn bill-bugs (Sphenophorus) were received from Greenville where they were reported to be doing much damage. Specimens of velvet beans which failed to ripen before frost were found to be infested with larvae, which proved to be those of an Anthribid, Brachytarsus variegatus. This is interesting as being the first information on the food of the larvae of this species, so far as known to the author. Most species of Brachytarsus feed on scale-insects, although they sometimes feed on seeds. They have not been observed to attack ripe velvet beans. Specimens of the mango scale (Pulvinaria psidii), which was introduced into Florida several years ago, were received from Buena Vista.},

   abstract = {Lepidosaphes ulmi, L. (Oyster-shell Scale) is probably as widely distributed as the San Jose scale and causes great injury to fruit trees throughout the United States. In some parts of Oregon it is quite common and very abundant on unsprayed fruit trees. Its operations are supposed not to be so serious as those of the San Jose scale as it rarely kills entire trees, though single branches will become so weak that they will not produce fruit and may die. This pest not only attacks fruit trees but a large number of shade trees, vines and bush fruits. It has been said that lime-sulphur will not destroy the eggs of this pest, but the authors have observed that where this spray is consistently used against the San Jose scale the oyster-shell scale does not thrive and no extra application is needed, and they think that the insect can be held in check with this spray. In the case of shade-trees and bush fruits which are often so badly infested that spraying is necessary, kerosene emulsion applied just as the eggs are hatched in the spring seems to be the best. A high pressure spraying pump should always be used. Lecanium corni, Bouche. The European Emit Leoauium Las only been found as a pest on prunes in Oregon, but in California it is known as the Brown Apricot Scale because of the serious damage done by it to apricot trees. Lime-sulphur is not very efficient against this insect and in case of serious attack the authors advise the use of what is known as the distillate oil emulsion spray, of which the following is the formula: - Hot water 12 gals., fish oil soap 30 lb., distillate oil (28 degrees Baume) 20 gals. The fish oil soap is made as follows: -Water 6 gals., lye 2 lb., fish oil 1 1/2 gals. These boiled together for about two hours will produce 40 lb. of soap. The spray is made by taking 5 1/2 gals, of the concentrated emulsion, adding to it 44 1/2 gals, of water and 1 lb. of caustic soda to soften the water. The mixing should be as thorough as possible and is best effected by repeatedly driving it through a force-pump back to the reservoir or containing vessel. Tibicen septemdecim, L. (Periodical Cicada). The adults of this insect only appear in the northern United States at intervals of 17 years and in the southern of 13 years. Many insecticides are effective against this pest, hut to be of real value they must be applied each day as long as the insects issue in numbers. Coating trees with whitewash or spraying with a strong solution of lime-sulphur offer possible means of preventing egg-deposition, as it has been stated that the cicadas do not like to sit on a white surface. Hemerocampa vetusta, Boisd. (Western Tussock Moth). This insect is at present limited to the Pacific Coast and on account of the similarity of its work to that of the Tent Caterpillar is often taken for one of those insects. The authors say that there is little danger that this insect will ever become a very serious pest, but nevertheless at times it requires special attention. Contact sprays appear to be entirely useless and the only methods that offer any chance of success are either to collect the eggs or to place sticky bands on the trees and then jar them; the larvae drop and cannot get past the bands as long as they are kept freshly painted with the sticky material. Tischeria malifoliella, Clemens? (Trumpet Leaf Miner of Apple). This insect is perhaps not of great importance to fruit-growers in Oregon, but occasionally it appears in very large numbers, as has been the case (luring the past 2 or 3 years. The damage done to the leaves by the larvae causes them to fall prematurely, thus interfering with the proper development of the fruit and the health of the tree. The best method of control appears to be to plough the orchards in the spring, burying as far as possible all the fallen leaves and trash, as it is in the former that the pupae pass the winter. This should be done not later than the time at which the trees are in blossom. Tmetocera ocellana, Schlieff:. (Eye-spotted Bud Moth). The larvae of this moth resemble those of the Peach nd Prune Twig Miner sufficiently closely to be taken for them, but this latter attacks only stone fruits and the former confines itself almost entirely to orchard trees. Spraying the trees with kerosene emulsion in early spring before the buds open, or spraying with arsenical mixture when the larvae are feeding, are good remedies; if done in the first week of September, this will also help to catch a great many larvae of the Codlin Moth. Sanninoidea opalescens, Hy. Edw. (Western Peach Root Borer). This has been reported only from four or five extreme western States. This is another insect so closely resembling an Eastern species as to be distinguishable only by the absence of a definite orange-coloured band across the abdomen. The habits of this Western species do not materially differ from those of the Eastern, both attacking trees to a greater extent in light sandy or gravelly soil, and peaches are most susceptible to attack, though prunes and apricots are almost equally favoured. Almonds, cherries, apples and native plums may be attacked. The Myro-balan plum is very little affected under normal conditions, and should be used as stocks upon which to graft the domestic plum. The Eastern agricultural authorities came to the conclusion that washes and poisonous substances with a disagreeable odour were practically useless as preventives, but the authors say that good results have been obtained both from the use of whitewash and Paris green and by spraying the bark with thick Bordeaux mixture and Paris green. Magdalis aenescens, Lec. (Bronze Apple Tree Weevil). Like many of the common insects found in Oregon, this appears to be a native of the north-west and has only been recorded from Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. Most of the feeding occurs in the bark and many growers have reported very serious injury to their trees. Careful examination of the bark and cutting out infested areas appears to be the most satisfactory methods of combating the pest. Rhagoletis cingulata, Loew (Cherry Fruit Fly). During the last year or two enquiries have been made for remedies against maggots which destroy cherries. The larvae of this insect probably live about three weeks, the mature stage being reached just about the time the fruit is ripe, and as they remain in the fruit for a short time after it is picked, they may be distributed over considerable areas. The adults are not strong on. the wing and can hardly do more than fly from tree to tree, or at the most from orchard to orchard. Many remedies have been tried but none of them has proved satisfactory. Syneta albida, Lec. (Fruit Tree Leaf Syneta). This insect is reported as having done considerable damage for some time post. There are practically no published accounts of its habits and life-history. The adults appear suddenly in the spring, are very abundant for a few weeks and then disappear almost as suddenly. Larvae have been found at a depth of 14 inches below the surface. The serious damage is done by adults; when the blossoms open in the spring they feed on the petals. Later in the season the leaves of apples and prunes are the principal parts eaten, and trees will often have holes in almost every leaf. Perhaps the most serious injury is done to young grafts, especially where whole orchards have been grafted over. The operations of the insect in these cases frequently kills the tree. Yarious remedies have been tried but none has proved satisfactory. Young grafts can be protected by the use of cheese-cloth. Bembecia marginata, Harr. (Raspberry Root Borer or Blackberry Crown Borer). This insect has made its appearance in certain of the bush, fruit districts of Oregon and though at present confined to a limited area will undoubtedly spread and become a serious pest. The authors consider that birds are the best natural enemies of this insect, as they have been observed catching and feeding upon the adult moths. Possibly some sticky substance applied to the canes in early autumn might prevent the larvae after hatching from crawling down the stalks to enter the root. Many of th larvae may be collected in old canes and stumps during June and July. Epitrix subscrinita, Lec. (Western Potato Flea Beetle). This is one of the very serious pests of the potato in Oregon. The summer generation, which really does the most injury, appears from the second week in July to the first week in August. There are two generations in the season. The beetles from the autumn brood hibernate as adults and attack the crops in the spring. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture appears to be the only useful remedy. Various other insects are noticed, including Ceresa bubalus, F. (Buffalo Tree Hopper), Notolopus sp. (Western Canker Worm), Oedemasia concinna, S. & A. (Red-humped Apple Caterpillar), Cacoesia rosana (Oblique-banded Leaf-roller) and Polycaon confertus (Oak Branch Borer).},

The widespread weeds in sesame field were crabgrass, goosegrass, copperleaf, purslane, wiregrass, wheat seedlings, barnyardgrass, Herba cephalanoploris, Amaranthus retroflexus, regional weeds were Cyperus rotundus, Convolvulus arvensis, Xanthium sibiricum, Celosia argentea, wild watermelon seedlings, Cucumis bisexualis, Abutilon. These weeds came out along with sesame seedlings. During the growth period of sesame, the water in the field for a long time caused waterlogging. Waterlogging and disease resistant varieties had high resistance to waterlogging. According to the occurrence regularity of sesame diseases, insect pests, weeds, waterlogging, by optimization of chemicals and technology integration, simplified green control technology was developed. The tests showed that after using this technology, it could increase production by 25.58%-52.17% compared with no control, and by 7.17%-13.51% compared with the conventional control, and the ratio of production to investment in general years was significantly improved.},
