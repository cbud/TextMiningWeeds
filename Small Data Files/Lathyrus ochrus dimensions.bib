 abstract = {Pesticide treatments provide an effective control of soilborne pests in vegetable and fruit crops, but their toxicity to animals and people and residual toxicity in plants and soil, and high cost make their use hazardous and economically inconvenient. Moreover, actual environmental legislation is imposing severe restrictions on the use or the total withdrawal of most soil-applied pesticides. Therefore, an increasing emphasis has been placed on the use of nonchemical or pesticide-reduced control methods. Soil solarization is a nonpesticidal technique which kills a wide range of soil pathogens, nematodes, and weed seed and seedlings through the high soil temperatures raised by placing plastic sheets on moist soil during periods of high ambient temperature. Direct thermal inactivation of target organisms was found to be the most important mechanism of solarization biocidal effect, contributed also by a heat-induced release of toxic volatile compounds and a shift of soil microflora to microorganisms antagonist of plant pathogens. Soil temperature and moisture are critical variables in solarization thermal effect, though the role of plastic film is also fundamental for the solarizing process, as it should increase soil temperature by allowing the passage of solar radiation while reducing energetic radiative and convective losses. Best solarizing properties were shown by low-density or vynilacetate-coextruded polyethylene formulations, but a wide range of plastic materials were documented as also suitable to soil solarization. Solar heating was normally reported to improve soil structure and increase soil content of soluble nutrients, particularly dissolved organic matter, inorganic nitrogen forms, and available cations, and shift composition and richness of soil microbial communities, with a marked increase of plant growth beneficial, plant pathogen antagonistic or root quick recolonizer microorganisms. As a consequence of these effects, soil solarization was largely documented to increase plant growth and crop yield and quality along more than two crop cycles. Most important fungal plant pathogenic species were found strongly suppressed by the solarizing treatment, as several studies documented an almost complete eradication of economically relevant pathogens, such as Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., Pythium spp., Sclerotium spp., Verticillium spp., and their related diseases in many vegetable and fruit crops and different experimental conditions. Beneficial effects on fungal pathogens were stated to commonly last for about two growing seasons and also longer. Soil solarization demonstrated to be effective for the control of bacterial diseases caused by Agrobacterium spp., Clavibacter michiganensis, and Erwinia amylovora, but failed to reduce incidence of tomato diseases caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum. Solarization was generally found less effective on phytoparasitic nematodes than on other organisms, due to their quicker soil recolonization compared to fungal pathogens and weeds, but field and greenhouse studies documented consistent reductions of root-knot severity and population densities of root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., as well as a satisfactory control of cyst nematode species, such as Globodera rostochiensis and Heterodera carotae, and bulb nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci. Weeds were variously affected by solar heating, as annual species were generally found almost completely suppressed and perennial species more difficult to control, due to the occurrence deep propagules not exposed to lethal temperature. Residual effect of solarization on weeds was found much more pronounced than on nematodes and most fungal pathogens. Soil solarization may be a perfect fit for all situations in which use of pesticides is restricted or completely banned, such as in organic production, or in farms located next to urban areas, or specialty crops with few labeled pesticides. Advantages of solarization also include economic convenience, as demonstrated by many comparative benefit/cost analyses, ease of use by growers, adaptability to many cropping systems, and a full integration with other control tools, which makes this technique perfectly compatible with principles of integrated pest management required by sustainable agriculture.},

 abstract = {The major food legumes that originated in the Mediterranean and that are important in this region include chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), and faba bean (Viciafaba L.). Lentil is an ancient cool-season field legume that has been traditionally grown in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Ethiopia, North Africa, and to a lesser extent, in southern Europe. It has also been introduced to South and North America. It is usually grown in rotation with cereals and is valued for both its seed for human consumption and straw for animal production. Archeological data has shown that lentil has been cultivated as early as 8000 BC in the Middle East (Hansen and Renfrew 1978). In the dryer regions of the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent lentil is one of the principal pulse crops cultivated and is a dietary mainstay of the populations of this region where it is an important source of protein. Faba bean (Viciafaba L.) is an old world legume with numerous references by ancient writers (Hawtin and Hebblethwaite 1983). The major producing countries for faba bean are China and Ethiopia. Faba bean is cultivated in Europe in the Mediterranean region and in northern Europe. Throughout North Africa and West Asia faba beans are an important component of the diet, especially of the poorer peoples and has been referred to as the â€œpoor manâ€™s meatâ€. Faba beans were introduced to South America with European colonization and are mostly grown at higher elevations where Phaseolus beans can not be grown. Faba bean is of a more recent introduction to North America where it is not of significance and to Australia, where the area has dramatically increased in the past ten years. Chickpea is a diploid, self-pollinated, leguminous crop that runs second in area and third in production among the pulses. It is cultivated primarily for its protein-rich seed, and the plant is an efficient symbiotic nitrogen-fixer, playing an important role in farming systems. Two types of chickpea are grown: desi, with angular and coloured sees, primarily grown in South Asia; and kabuli, with large, owl-shaped and beige-coloured seeds, grown in the Mediterranean region, the USA and Latin America.},

Weeds of cereals in Chaonia (Morocco) I. The flora
An inventory of weeds of cereals in the Chaonia region of Morocco was made on the basis of 218 botanical surveys. A total of 315 species in 45 families were noted. Dicotyledons (87%) were predominant (mostly Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae and Apiaceae) and 77% of the species were therophytes. There was a high percentage (64%) of Meditteranean species and 5% endemics. The major weeds of the reguri were determined from the abundance and frequency of species. Geophytes (particularly Convolvulus spp., Arisarum vulgare and Silene vulgaris) were preponderant, although the traditional annual cereal weeds were most numerous owing to the lack of agricultural intensification.

 abstract = {The diversity of the genus Vicia L. (vetches) provides a wealth of domesticated crop plants for Mediterranean and temperate agriculture. The levels of domestication (soft seededness, high grain yield, high harvest index, +/- reduced shattering, +/- high biomass) found in several Vicia spp make them attractive as grain and forage crops for dryland farming. Species such as V. sativa L., V. narbonensis L., V. articulata Hornem. and V. pannonica are candidates for further domestication towards grain legume status. Vetches have an advantage over most of the food legumes in being better suited to hay production and most are thus dual purpose crops. They will have an increasing role as animal protein becomes scarcer and more expensive. Vetches already occupy special niches in farming systems because of their wide adaptation and ability to grow where food legumes are not suited. These include extremes of winter cold and very dry conditions. They may also be considered as alternative leguminous break crops where diseases and pests may otherwise limit the production of traditional food legumes. Despite these inherent advantages, their potential role as food legumes in human diets is largely unexplored. Traditional barriers need to be overcome and breeders will have to ensure that their product is free of toxins. The current program at ICARDA is one of the few in the world aimed at enhancing the value of vetches by improving quality, harvest index and harvestability, while Australian scientists are screening V. sativa, V. narbonensis and V. ervilia collections for genotypes with higher seed production, reduced toxicity and improved palatability. The relative lack of breeding effort in itself is a barrier to domestication.},

We compiled the floristic catalogue by including all vascular plant entities that occur spontaneously within the administrative boundaries of the Rome municipality. The data, which were gathered from extensive field surveys, from a broad review of the literature and from herbaria records, were updated and integrated in a comprehensive account. The inventory of the flora of metropolitan Rome lists 1649 entities, from 139 families and 677 genera. The flora contains 228 taxa that are non-native to the Italian flora, 81 of which are established in the study area. The overview of flora reveals a remarkable species diversity and outlines the main characteristics of the flora of Rome, which may be summarized as (1) a large number of taxa of high conservation value which occur in remnants of near-natural vegetation, (2) the loss or decline of some species, particularly of native freshwater plants, (3) a remarkably high native species richness within the urban area, which includes many native woody species and (4) a rich ruderal flora, prevalently composed of native species that are well adapted to human disturbance, along with a variety of taxa of non-native or uncertain origin. The large set of data and the overview presented in this paper represent a fundamental framework for future research and for the conservation of plant diversity in metropolitan Rome.},

 abstract = {In the very large areas of arid highlands in West Asia, of which land over 1000 m in Balochistan is typical, as a result of rapidly increasing numbers of small ruminants and subsequent overgrazing of natural rangelands, severe shortages in animal feed are being experienced. To address this problem the And Zone Research Institute (AZRI) have been evaluating annual forage legume germplasm for adaptability to the harsh climatic conditions of highland Balochistan. Due to the marginality of the environment for sustained crop production an unconventional germplasm evaluation strategy has been adopted which emphasizes the introduction of landraces, particularly of the genus Vicia. The substantial risk of crop failure from either cold or drought, in any year, makes continuity of seed supply of selected lines a major problem. Support from ICARDA in Syria for re-supply of seed is a major advantage to the AZRI program.
In the last three years some tangible progress has been made in selection. V. villosa ssp. dasycarpa Ace. 683 has with autumn sowing shown sufficient cold tolerance and is highly productive in wet years. V. ervilia Ace. 2542 has shown some potential for drought tolerance which could be exploited for spring sowing.},

 abstract = {K. 454 Theoretical argument â€¦ From this opening paragraph Galen clearly has in mind the epistemological debate about the nature of medical knowledge. On the one hand there was the view that it could be revealed by a theoretical approach, one which we might now call deductive but which at that time was termed Rational or Dogmatic (the Greek dogma meaning, among other things, doctrine). The holders of this view, a rather diverse group, stressed the importance of a knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and of understanding the obscure as well as the evident causation of disease. One the other hand there was another view that all therapeutic (and more generally, medical) knowledge was the outcome of experience alone, an approach which we might term inductive, but which then, as indeed now, was referred to as Empirical (from the Greek empeiria, meaning experience). And so there were those practitioners who were called Rationalists and those termed Empiricists. A third group of Methodists held quite different views. They did not deny that elements of both the Rationalist and Empiricist positions were of interest, but they did deny that treatment should be based upon them. Instead they postulated three body states, the constricted, the lax and the mixed, which determine the nature of therapy. They also held the view that all of medicine could be learnt in a few months, and required no prior education in philosophy, mathematics and the like.},

 abstract = {Allelopathy is a biological process including interactions between two plants through the production of chemical compounds (allelochemicals) that are released by leaching, volatilization, decomposition, or root exudation. Hence, allelopathy together with competition is a promising environment-friendly tool especially for weed management. However, detailed knowledge of this phenomenon is necessary for its successful application due to very still limited available knowledge. Suitable use of allelopathic crops in agriculture could reduce the pesticide application and thereby reduce the environmental and food pollution, decrease costs in agriculture, improve food security in poor regions and soil productivity, and increase biodiversity and sustainability in the agro-ecosystem. Weed management in organic agriculture is one of the most difficult aspects of organic farming and uses especially preventive methods that include ways such as cover crops, mulches, green manure, and intercropping in which allelopathy could play an important role. Therefore, this review focuses on the possibilities of the allelopathy application especially in organic agriculture. Roots of allelopathic plants as cover crops, intercrops, green manure, or so-called smothering crops or decomposing residues release compounds in the soil that are toxic to weeds. The weed-suppressive effect is influenced by species, planting date, seeding rate and method, weather, and other factors. Decomposition time of plant residues and amounts of biomass are important factors of weed control by mulching. Annual, biennial, or perennial herbaceous plants in a pure or mixed stand can be grown for these purposes. Biofumigation is the name for one type of allelopathy that includes the effects of the chemicals, i.e., highly toxic isothiocyanates, produced by Brassica green manure. The balance in the crop rotation is necessary due to possible autotoxicity. These days, allelopathic plants as catch crops or trap crops found utilization in plant protection of tropical regions against parasite weeds, because they can reduce the parasite seed bank by 72%. Other applications of allelopathy for weed control include the use of plant residues as an herbicide agent, e.g., water extracts, pellets, flours, by-products of crop processing, etc. Sorgaab, an extract of sorghum, is produced commercially as a natural herbicide. Allelopathic compounds act as repellents for herbivorous pests, so the same strategy used in weed control could be effective against pests and pathogens, e.g., pushâ€“pull strategy. All possible applications of allelopathy need to combine with other methods of plant protection. Newly investigated pollen allelopathy could reduce reproductive ability of wind pollination annual weeds. Pollen of allelopathic species would be artificially dusted on the stigmatic surface of other plants. This phenomenon is yet to be studied and field tested. The new crop varieties with elevated allelopathic activity could be a great chance not only for organic farming. Hybridization could be the promising method. However, allelopathic activity was identified as a quantitative trait and therefore this characteristic is affected by both genetic effects and environmental conditions.},

Analysis of the data has allowed gaps in the floristic knowledge of the Park, such as comparatively or completely unexplored areas, to be identified, together with those species records that still require confirmation and/or further study. On the basis of these deductions, fieldwork aimed at the collection of new floristic data was carried out.

 abstract = {Bacterial blight caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi is an important, but sporadic, disease of field peas (Pisum sativum) in Australia. The presence of P. syringae pv. pisi reduces the profitability of peas due to yield loss and, in some cases, it also limits Australiaâ€™s export of peas to some countries. Pseudomonoas syringae pv. pisi is primarily a seed-borne pathogen, but infected pea trash can be an important source of inoculum. Alternative hosts and soil are not regarded as epidemiologically important sources of inoculum. P. syringae pv. pisi survives, multiplies and spreads epiphytically in pea crops. Epiphytic populations of P. syringae pv. pisi only become pathogenic following crop damage caused by frost or severe weather conditions. Frost damage is especially important because the ice nucleating activity of P. syringae pv. pisi initiates frost damage at higher temperatures than occurs in the absence of the bacterium. In addition early-sown crops are more prone to damage from bacterial blight than crops sown later in the season. Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi consists of seven identified races. One of these (Race 6) lacks all avirulence genes and is common around the world and in Australia. Globally, Race 2 and Race 6 predominate; however, in Australia, Race 3 predominates due to the widespread cultivation of cultivars susceptible to Race 3, but resistant to Race 2. Resistance to Race 6 within P. sativum has not been found but attempts are being made to incorporate a race non-specific resistance identified from P. abyssinicum into field pea. Bacterial blight can be successfully controlled using an integrated disease management strategy incorporating crop rotation, pathogen-free seed, avoidance of planting in areas prone to frequent frosts or extreme wet weather, crop hygiene and avoiding early sowing. Seed treatment and application of foliar bactericides have limited use in control of this disease.},

 abstract = {This book presents visual plant defenses (camouflage, mimicry and aposematism via coloration, morphology and even movement) against herbivores. It is mainly an ideological monograph, a manifesto representing my current understanding on defensive plant coloration and related issues. The book is not the final word in anything, but rather the beginning of many things. It aims to establish visual anti-herbivory defense as an integral organ of botany, or plant science as it is commonly called today. I think that like in animals, many types of plant coloration can be explained by selection associated with the sensory/cognitive systems of herbivores and predators to reduce herbivory. It is intended to intrigue and stimulate students of botany/plant science and plant/animal interactions for a very long time. This book is tailored to a readership of biologists and naturalists of all kinds and levels, and more specifically for botanists, ecologists, evolutionists and to those interested in plant/animal interactions. It is written from the point of view of a naturalist, ecologist and evolutionary biologist that I hold, considering natural selection as the main although not the only drive for evolution. According to this perspective, factors such as chance, founder effects, genetic drift and various stochastic processes that may and do influence characters found in specific genotypes, are not comparable in their power and influence to the common outcomes of natural selection, especially manifested when very many species belonging to different plant families, with very different and separate evolutionary histories, arrive at the same adaptation, something that characterizes many of the visual patterns and proposed adaptations described and discussed in this book. Many of the discussed visual defensive mechanisms are aimed at operating before the plants are damaged, i.e., to be their first line of defense. In this respect, I think that the name of the book by Ruxton et al. (2004) "Avoiding Attack" is an excellent phrase for the assembly of the best types of defensive tactics. While discussing anti-herbivory, I do remember, study and teach physiological/developmental aspects of some of the discussed coloration patterns, and I am fully aware of the simultaneous and diverse functions of many plant characters in addition to defense.},

 abstract = {Summary Studies on the host range of Orobanche ramosa L., by screening different Summer and Winter crops, medicinal herbs, and a large number of weeds for possible attack by the parasite, revealed substantial variation among species in the number and vigour of parasites attached to their roots. The crops and medicinal herbs most affected were: Apium graveolens, Carthamis tinctorius, Carum carvi, and Trachyspermum ammi (with 36 â€“ 214 Orobanche shoots per pot). Among the crops studied, Ammi visnaga, Brassica nigra, B. oleracea var. botrytis, Cucurbita moschata, Linum usitatissimum, Lupinus albus, and Raphanus sativus were least infected (with 1 â€“ 2 Orobanche shoots per pot). Weeds, including Datura metel, Ferula communis, and Rumex acetosella were heavily infected (with 40 â€“ 67 shoots per pot). In contrast, Antirrhinum orontium, Convolvulus arvensis, Diplotaxis erucoides, Polygonum aviculare and Solanum cornutum showed extremely low infection (with 1 â€“ 2 shoots per pot). T. ammi is reported, for the first time, as a potential â€œtrap speciesâ€ for O. ramosa. Other plants tested are useful as â€œcatch speciesâ€ and both may be used effectively to manage infestation by the parasite by their inclusion in crop rotation or intercropping systems. Non-host species, or those that allowed very low parasite attachment may be grown in fields heavily-infested by the parasite. Control of highly-infected weed species is necessary to prevent parasite multiplication and spread. However, timing this operation after parasite attachment, or before emergence may be effective in exhausting the soil seed-bank, providing the weeds do not pose a serious competition with the crop plants. Many of the plant species tested were not attacked, suggesting a different mechanism of resistance, or lack of stimulants for O. ramosa seed germination. Of the species reported to be good â€œtrap cropsâ€ for this parasite, L. usitatissimum showed very low infection, but B. campestris, C. frutescens, C. annuum, Coriandrum sativum, and T. foenum-graecum were heavily infected.},

 abstract = {As occurred on many other small Mediterranean islands, agricultural activity at Lampedusa (Strait of Sicily) underwent a very strong decline in terms of surface area during the second half of the last century. In particular, cereal crops have ceased and horticulture is disappearing, while vineyards still occupy a reduced area but are quickly vanishing and currently survive thanks to a small number of old farmers. Here are presented the results of a research carried out by interviewing seven farmers in order to study not only the techniques and the germplasm used in local viticulture, but also the final use of grapes and an evaluation on the connection between traditional farming and agro-ecosystems plant species-richness. Vines were grown for wine, to produce fresh and sun-dried grapes, or to preserve them in alcohol. Several names of the local varieties suggest that they might have been introduced in Lampedusa from the neighbouring territories: being fishermen and farmers at the same time, local people had trade relationships with other Mediterranean areas such as Tunisia, Malta and Southern Italy. Furthermore, local farming plays a key role in plant conservation. In fact, the disappearance of agricultural systems is leading to the extinction of 43 plant species, some of them considered rare not only on the local level, but also on the regional and national one. Because of the small size of farmland and its fragmentation, local agriculture cannot be supported by the European Community. Therefore, in order to safeguard local viticulture, special systems of assistance and new managing policies - focused on rural development plans and showing which concrete actions are necessary and feasible to protect the agroecosystems - are needed.},

 abstract = {Didymella pinodes is the principal causal agent of ascochyta blight, one of the most important fungal diseases of pea (Pisum sativum) worldwide. Understanding its host specificity has crucial implications in epidemiology and management; however, this has not been clearly delineated yet. In this study we attempt to clarify the host range of D. pinodes and to compare it with that of other close Didymella spp. D. pinodes was very virulent on pea accessions, although differences in virulence were identified among isolates. On the contrary, studied isolates of D. fabae, D. rabiei, and D. lentil showed a reduced ability to infect pea not causing macroscopically visible symptoms on any of the pea accessions tested. D. pinodes isolates were also infective to some extend on almost all species tested including species such as Hedysarum coronarium, Lathyrus sativus, Lupinus albus, Medicago spp., Trifolium spp., Trigonella foenum-graecum, and Vicia articulata which were not mentioned before as hosts of D. pinodes. On the contrary, D. lentil and D. rabiei were more specific, infecting only lentil and chickpea, respectively. D. fabae was intermediate, infecting mainly faba bean, but also slightly other species such as Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris, Trifolium spp., Vicia sativa, and V. articulata. DNA sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was performed to confirm identity of the isolates studies and to determine phylogenetic relationship among the Didymella species, revealing the presence of two clearly distinct clades. Clade one was represented by two supported subclusters including D. fabae isolates as well as D. rabiei with D. lentil isolates. Clade two was the largest and included all the D. pinodes isolates as well as Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella. Genetic distance between D. pinodes and the other Didymella spp. isolates was not correlated with overall differences in pathogenicity. Based on evidences presented here, D. pinodes is not specialized on pea and its host range is larger than that of D. fabae, D. lentil, and D. rabiei. This has relevant implications in epidemiology and control as these species might act as alternative hosts for D. pinodes. },

The conservation and use of legume species, and for that matter all biodiversity, is of increasing national and regional importance in the Mediterranean. We need the genetic diversity of peas, chickpeas, lentils and faba beans, as well as the various forage legume species to provide food security for humans and their domesticated animals, both in the Mediterranean region itself and in other regions of the world with Mediterranean climates. This is necessary because ofthe current loss ofecosystems, habitats, species and genetic diversity worldwide, and particularly the Mediterranean region, but also because of the ever present need to feed the increasing human population (Maxted et al., 1997a). There is a catastrophic loss of plant genetic diversity occurring: species, gene combinations and alleles are being lost for perpetuity (Diversity, 1999). This degradation (i.e. genetic erosion) is increasing exponential and shows no signs of abatement. We need to conserve plant diversity because of the direct benefits to humankind that can arise from its exploitation in new agricultural and horticultural crops, the development of medicinal drugs but also because of the pivotal role played by plants in the functioning of all natural ecosystems.},

Information is also accumulating on Vicia and Lathyrus species, confirming their potential for the West Asia and North Africa region. Annual Trifolium species are also widely distributed in the region.

In temperate areas livestock is grazed on domesticated forages. In the tropics livestock use native grasslands (Africa, Australia), naturalized grasslands (tropical America, Asia), or grasslands improved with selected wild species (tropical America). The worldwide exchange of forage germplasm has involved relatively few accessions of some widely adapted species, and the need exists to increase the diversity of these cultivated forages. BOTANY AND DISTRIBUTION Forages comprise different species, mostly from the Gramineae and Leguminosae families. Forages that have been domesticated and cultivated since historical times include lucerne (Medicago saliva L.), berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (Mannetje et al. 1980). Others have been cultivated more recently, such as white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L. sensu lato), ryegrasses (Lolium), Festuca and Phalaris. Wild species have been distributed and used widely: 40 million ha of Brachiaria decumbens Stapf in South America (Miles et al. 1996) and about 1 million ha of Stylosanthes species in Australia. A great number of families, genera and species can be considered as forage and it is not practical to give botanical details of every species, including synonyms.

Data on the target plants and relevant traditional knowledge were collected during autumn and winter of 2013 and spring of 2014. These data upon (e.g. plant harvested, local name, part of plant used and type of use) were obtained from the informants by semi-structured and structured interviews. Accordingly, a total number of 135 informants of various ages and backgrounds and with a sound traditional knowledge of the target plants were interviewed. A total of 47 species (8 medicinal, 18 edible and 21 edible-medicinal) belonging to 26 families was recorded as a result of the structured interviews. 11 of the species are cultivated in small-scale home gardens. The species are collected for a variety purposes, including traditional food (47Â %), spice (16Â %), pickle and/or appetizer (9Â %), herbal tea (11Â %), medicine (2Â %), ornament (2Â %), fruits and/or jam (13Â %). The plant parts most widely used are young stems (36Â %), leaves (33Â %), fruits (14Â %), flowers (5Â %), aerial part (4Â %), young shoots (4Â %), bulbs (3Â %) and roots (1Â %). Major processing techniques include: boiled (24Â %), raw (19Â %) and spice for food flavouring (15Â %). Assessment of the associated traditional knowledge shows that this knowledge has been in decline in the region due to the impact of modernization. A range of responses for the maintenance and transmission of traditional knowledge with the target plants (e.g. establishment of a database, support for small-scale cultivation in home gardens and eco-labelling of the plant material) were proposed. It is hoped that the results of this study will draw attention on the neglect of traditional knowledge in the island of Cyprus in terms of its significance for intangible cultural heritage, biodiversity conservation, sustainable rural development strategies and the vitality of traditional food systems.},

 abstract = {The genetic diversity of the genus Lathyrus is of immense significance, particularly for rain-fed cropping systems of many countries (Campbell et al., 1994) as a resource for the improvement ofL. sativus L., but also because the genus is largely under-utilised. Several species are cultivated for food, feed, and fodder, as well as for ornamental purposes (Sarker et al., 1997), but there is potential for further exploitation of the Lathyrus gene pool. Therefore, the collection, conservation, characterization, study of genetic diversity and utilization of the genus Lathyrus is a priority. There is an urgent need actively conserve the genetic diversity of the genus using both ex-situ (gene banks) and in-situ (natural habitats) techniques. This will permit a critical assessment to be made of the genetic diversity, evolution and genetic erosion of the genus, as well as greatly enhancing further exploitation (Sabanci, 1996).},

 abstract = {Livestock are an integral part of farming systems in the Mediterranean basin where crop production is limited by large seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature. These variations lead to a marked seasonality of feed supply which is a major constraint to livestock production. As it is generally agreed that a plentiful and balanced nutrient supply is the foundation of efficient livestock production, research at ICARDA during the past 10 years has focused on developing cereal-based crop rotations which include leguminous forage crops and pastures and using cereal straws. This paper outlines that research and presents some solutions. However, this focus does not imply that non-nutritional factors are less important. Indeed, the main aim of this workshop is to identify non-nutritional constraints that limit small ruminant productivity in Mediterranean areas. By turning our attention in the future to non-nutritional constraints, we imply that we have some understanding of nutritional constraints. The geographical area covered includes North African countries with a Mediterranean coast and West Asian countries with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Areas with steppe vegetation will be briefly discussed, but generally the paper focuses on areas receiving above 250 mm rainfall. Much of the research also applies to southern Europe.},

 abstract = {Forage legumes are vitally important to animal production in the dryland farming systems of the Mediterranean region. Of the diverse forage-legume species adapted to the Mediterranean climate, vetches, (Vicia spp.), chicklings (Lathyrus spp.), annual medics (Medicago spp), clovers (Trifolium spp.) and species of the Lupinus, Lotus, Onobrychis, Hedysarum and Ornithopus genera are considered to be the most agronomically important and economically valuable species for the region. Adoption of perennial self-regenerating medic (Medicago spp.) has been limited because of technical difficulties, but annual vetch (Vicia spp.) has the greatest potential as a viable animal-feed source and a rotation crop with cereals. Some forage legumes survive harsh conditions by their unique underground growth habit, for example, V.Â amphicarpa and Lathyrus ciliolatus. Efforts to improve forage legumes have been based on both management/cultural factors and breeding. Research based on several long-term barley- and wheat-based rotation trials has demonstrated the viability of forage legumes, especially vetch, in the region's improved farming system. An additional benefit to such legumes is the enhancement of soil quality, that is, soil fertility, soil organic matter and soil physical properties. Thus, the development of forage legumes is essential to agricultural sustainability in the Mediterranean region and in other dryland cereal-growing areas of the world where grazing livestock is a dominant enterprise. To build upon the considerable research conducted on forages, intensified efforts are needed to develop locally adapted forage cultivars, to provide economic assessment of forages in cropping systems and to promote technology transfer at the farm and community level.},

Laboratory and field screening of five lines each of six forage legumes (Vicia narbonensis L., V. sativa L., V. villosa ssp. dasycarpa (Ten.) Cavill., Lathyrus sativus L., L. ochrus (L.)D.C., and L. cicera L.) for resistance to the parasitic weed Orobanche crenata Forsk. revealed high interspecific and intraspecific variation. Lathyrus ochrus lines were free of emerged O. crenata shoots while those of L. sativus and L. cicera were highly susceptible to the parasite. Intraspecific variation in reaction to O. crenata was high within V. narbonensis and V. sativa, with several lines being free of Orobanche parasitism whereas others were highly susceptible. Lines with high resistance to Orobanche can reduce the build-up of a seed bank of the parasite in areas where mainly food legumes are grown and can be of value for developing integrated Orobanche control systems. The laboratory screening, which is faster and cheaper, reliably predicted the field performance and hence retesting in the field can be restricted to those lines found resistant in the laboratory.},

Quantitative and qualitative features were evaluated to identify groups of species using a phenetic analysis. The used characters were that of testa (luster, multicellular sculpture and homogeneity of cell-size); anticlinal walls (level, undulation, thickness and 2ry sculpture); outer periclinal walls (level and 2ry sculpture); hilum (shape and length/ width ratio) and the seed length/width ratio. Nine multi-cellular sculptures and three patterns of secondary sculpture of anticlinal walls were recorded. The most common and remarkable pattern was the prominent stellate like structures on the angles of the anticlinal walls. Many terms used for describing patterns should be reevaluated within the whole tribe to better define of the character states for the multicellular sculpture. The present data were useful to recognize species or groups of species by a unique or combination of character states and had supported the retaining of Lathyrus tingitanus and L. tuberosus in section Lathyrus; the placement of L. neurolobus and L. nissolia in two different monotypic sections; the distinctiveness of the species of sections Aphaca and Pratensis.

T1587, Lens culinaris Med. acc. ILL6002/cv. Digger, Vicia faba L. cv. Fiord, and P. sativum L. cv. Dundale) were compared with potential new grain legume species (L. atlanticus L. accs P22924/P22927, L. pilosus Murr. acc. P23030, V. narbonensis L. acc. ACT60104, Lathyrus cicera L. acc. 495, L. ochrus (L.) DC acc. 537, L. sativus L. acc. 453, V. benghalensis L. cv. Early purple, and V. sativa L. cv. Languedoc) in low rainfall Mediterranean-type environments of southwestern Australia. Species were compared on fine-textured, neutral to alkaline soils, at two fields sites (Merredin and Mullewa), and in two consecutive growing seasons (1993 and 1994). At Merredin, a section of each trial was irrigated at regular intervals commencing at flowering and ending just before maturity. V. faba and P. sativum were generally the highest yielding grain legume species at both field sites, and in the two years that the species were compared (> 200 g/m2 at Merredin in 1993 and at Mullewa in both years, and > 100 g/m2 at Merredin in 1994 which had below-average rainfall). Seed yields of V. faba and P. sativum were comparable with or greater than those of wheat. Both grain legume species yielded well in the water-limited environments because of their early flowering and podding, which allowed pod filling to occur in winter when temperatures were low and soil moisture conditions were most favourable. This early flowering and podding was matched with vigorous early growth, which laid the potential for a large total biomass. Seed yields of the other commercially-grown grain legume species were smaller than those of V. faba and P. sativum. Yields of C. arietinum at Merredin were severely reduced by frost damage in both years, implying that with current cultivars/accessions frosts represent a significant risk to this crop in susceptible areas. None of the potential new Lupinus, Lathyrus, and Vicia species that were tested consistently produced the seed yields of current commercial cultivars of V. faba or P. sativum. Nevertheless, most species produced substantial biomass at maturity at each site, particularly in years of higher rainfall and in irrigated plots (> 425 g/m2 at Merredin in 1993 and in irrigated plots), confirming their adaptation to fine-textured, neutral to alkaline soils. Low seed yields of species were attributed to later flowering and podding relative to V. faba and P. sativum. Selecting for more rapid crop development in the new grain legume species is likely to increase seed yields of these species in the short-season environments of southwestern Australia.},

 abstract = {Cool season food legumes (CSFLs) are increasingly being grown in marginal areas, where yield and production stability are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses to which they lack adequate resistance. Wild relatives of CSFLs possess valuable genes for resistance/tolerance to several of these stresses. Recently wide hybridization has shown potential for the genetic improvement of CSFLs. Genes for resistance to cyst nematode, and tolerance to cold have been transferred to chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) from its closest relatives. The transfer of tolerance to cold is also being pursued in lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus). Wide hybridization could play a role in improving the adaptation of CSFLs. The tertiary gene-pool (GP3) of the CSFLs includes desirable variation. Embryo-ovule culture could play a role in expanding the hybridization range of the CSFLs if this technique were refined. The superior agronomic phenotypes produced following wide hybridization in Cicer and Lens, underlines the importance of assessing the breeding value of wild accessions in hybrid combinations with their cultivated counterparts. Collaboration is needed at the international level, between national programs, gene banks and International Agricultural Research Centers, to tackle the complexity of wide crossing systematically. This paper reviews recent progress on wide hybridization in CSFLs.},

 abstract = {New plant taxa from around the world continue to be imported into Australia and New Zealand. Many of these taxa have the potential to become agricultural or environmental weeds and this risk needs to be assessed before allowing their entry. A weed risk assessment system is described that uses information on a taxon's current weed status in other parts of the world, climate and environmental preferences, and biological attributes. The system is designed to be operated by quarantine personnel via a user-friendly computer interface.The model was tested against experts' scores for weediness for 370 taxa present in Australia, representing both weeds and useful taxa from agriculture, the environment, and other sectors. The model was judged on its ability to correctly â€˜rejectâ€™ weeds, â€˜acceptâ€™ non-weeds, and generate a low proportion of taxa which could not be decisively categorised, termed â€˜evaluateâ€™. More than 70% of the taxa were rejected or accepted. All taxa classified as serious weeds, and most minor weeds, were rejected or required further evaluation, while only 7% of non-weeds were rejected. The model was modified to New Zealand conditions and evaluated against the opinions of several groups of experts and against economic measures. The model produced a weediness score very similar to the mean of the experts scores. The latter were highly variable: agriculturalists tended to accept known weeds, conservationists tended to reject most adventive taxa, and only botanists produced scores similar to the model. The model scores also tended to be independent of economic value as measured in this study. The model could be adapted for use as a screening tool in any region of the world.},

Moreover, plants are also capable of complex recognition of self and non-self and are territorial in behavior. They are as sophisticated in behavior as animals but their potential has been masked because it operates on time scales many orders of magnitude less than those of animals.

The plants were grown under the same conditions in Poland. Some phenological and morphological traits of plants as well as some seed morphological properties and nutritive value were investigated. Lathyrus sativus seeds contained more protein (average 300Â g vs. 255Â gÂ kgâˆ’1 dry matter (DM)), whereas the differences in the average contents of the other basic nutrients between both these species as well as between particular accessions were not substantial. Except for a low level of methionine, the protein of both species showed fairly high concentration of other exogenic amino acids (EAAI around 63â€“64%). Fat of both L. sativus and L. cicera seeds was found to contain a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (66.9 and 58.6%, respectively), mainly linoleic (57.4 and 47.2%, respectively). The researched L. sativus accessions had a quite low level of Î²-ODAP (733Â mg with a range of 0.583â€“1.340Â mgÂ kgâˆ’1 DM). Slightly higher content of this ANF (1,168Â mg with 911â€“1,349Â mgÂ kg âˆ’1 DM) in L. cicera seeds was noted. Average tannin concentration in the L. sativus and L. cicera accessions reached 3.3 and 6.4Â gÂ kgâˆ’1 DM, respectively. Average content of this ANF in L. sativus significantly correlated with the colour of both, flowers and seeds; with generally, a darker colour associated with higher levels of tannins.},

Languedoc) to low-rainfall Mediterranean-type environments of southwestern Australia was examined in relation to canopy development, radiation interception, and dry-matter production. Species were grown at one location, and in two consecutive growing seasons (1993 and 1994). Dry-matter production was large for most species, particularly in 1993 (maximum biomass > 580 g/m2 for all species except L. pilosus) which had above-average rainfall. V. faba and P. sativum developed greater maximum biomass than other species, and this was associated with high crop growth rates (CGR) during the early part of the growing season and large maximum CGR. Other species which produced large maximum biomass (V. narbonensis and L. ochrus in 1993) developed dry matter more slowly during the early stages of plant growth, but achieved maximum CGR similar to those obtained for V. faba and P. sativum. CGR of these species increased rapidly close to flowering as air temperatures began to rise. Species which produced large maximum biomass intercepted a greater amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (r = 0.73* and 0.70** in 1993 and 1994, respectively). There were differences among species in the efficiency with which intercepted PAR was converted into biomass (radiation-use efficiency), but these differences did not closely reflect differences in dry-matter production. Cumulative intercepted PAR was positively correlated with the fraction of incident PAR intercepted by species (r = 0.87** and 0.96** in 1993 and 1994, respectively), but was poorly correlated with cumulative incident PAR. Differences among species in intercepted PAR were therefore not related to differences in the length of time species were intercepting incident PAR (a function of crop phenology). Greater fraction of incident PAR intercepted by species was closely related to green (photosynthetic) area duration (GAD) (r = 0.60* and 0.78* in 1993 and 1994, respectively), but was poorly correlated with the efficiency with which green area intercepted PAR (described by the extinction coefficient). Maximum biomass of species was also closely related to GAD (r = 0.78** and 0.84** in 1993 an 1994, respectively). These results indicate that in low-rainfall Mediterranean-type environments, grain legume species should be selected for the development of large green area index (GAI), which should maximise the interception of PAR, production of dry matter, and consequently seed yield of the crop.},

 abstract = {Il Lago di Burano Ã¨ situato a sud del Promontorio di Ansedonia, vicino al confine con il Lazio (comune di Capalbio, Gr). Nel presente lavoro vengono riportati i risultati dell'indagine floristica effettuata tramite erborizzazioni eseguite nel periodo 1995â€“1999; ci siamo avvalsi anche di dati bibliografici e di campioni raccolti all'inizio degli anni '90 durante studi micologici. Ad una breve parte introduttiva relativa a lineamenti fisici, climatici e vegetazionali del territorio, segue l'elenco della flora vascolare, corredato di note esplicative per le entitÃ  di particolare interesse fitogeografico e/o conservazionistico. L'indagine ha condotto alla realizzazione di una lista di 522 taxa; le piante spontanee o spontaneizzate ammontano a 492, 10 sono le specie introdotte in tempi recenti, 20 ricavate da dati bibliografici e non riconfermate dagli autori. La flora spontanea attuale Ã¨ ripartita in 301 generi e 81 famiglie. Tra questi segnaliamo le entitÃ  di notevole interesse nel quadro fitogeografico della Toscana e talvolta anche dell'Italia: i) specie endemiche o prossime al limite del loro areale di distribuzione come: Dorycnium rectum, Fumaria bicolor, Linaria purpurea subsp. cossoni, Polygonum romanum e Quercus frainetto; ii) specie psammofile quali Crucianella maritima, Euphorbia paralias, Medicago marina, Matthiola sinuata, Stachys maritima, oggi per lo piÃ¹ annoverate tra le entitÃ  vulnerabili per la Toscana; iii) specie rare ed a distribuzione frammentaria legate ad aree umide, salmastre o dulciacquicole, quali Aeluropus littoralis, Artemisia coerulescens var. palmata, Carex extensa, C. riparia, Cladium mariscus, Eleocharis uniglumis, Euphorbia palustris, Halimione portu- lacoides, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Orchis palustris, Plantago cornuti, Ranunculus sceleratus, Spartina juncea, Spirodela polyrrhiza, Stachys palustris. I dati raccolti hanno permesso di rilevare come attualmente la Riserva del Lago di Burano, grazie alla tutela a cui Ã¨ stata sottoposta da ormai molti anni, rappresenti uno dei settori costieri della Toscana meglio conservati sotto il profilo floristico.},

 abstract = {The use of two closely related species, Lathyrus cicera and L. sativus, as grain legumes for human and animal consumption, dates to the Neolithic period. Due to its tolerance to harsh environmental conditions L. sativus is still used widely for human food in Ethiopia and the Indian sub-continent, although cultivation has diminished in many other regions.The grain of both L. cicera and L. sativus contains a neurotoxin, 3-(-N-oxalyl)-l-2,3-diamino propionic acid (ODAP), which can cause a paralysis of the lower limbs (lathyrism). Due to the occurrence of lathyrism in humans recent plant breeding has produced cultivars with low ODAP concentrations. The susceptibility of animal species to lathyrism is poorly understood, although horses and young animals are more susceptible. Older published animal feeding studies are of limited use, since the presence and role of ODAP was unknown until the 1960s. More recent feeding studies indicate that low ODAP lines of L. cicera or L. sativus can be safely incorporated at inclusion rates up to 40, 30 and 70% of the diet of poultry, pigs and sheep, respectively, without growth reductions.The compositions of both L. cicera and L. sativus are similar to other commonly used feed grain legumes, respective protein contents are 25 and 27%. Antinutritional factors (ANFs), other than ODAP, are present in both L. cicera and L. sativus at concentrations similar to those found in other grain legumes; including trypsin inhibitors, chymotrypsin inhibitors, amylase inhibitors, lectins, tannins, phytate and oligosaccharides. The effect of ANFs in L. cicera and L. sativus on animal performance is not well understood and sometimes confounded with ODAP effects. Heating of grain will reduce levels of the proteinaceous ANFs and in some cases ODAP as well.Variation recorded in the germplasm of L. cicera and L. sativus has not been greatly utilised in plant breeding to lower levels of ANFs, with the exception of ODAP, leaving considerable potential for rapid improvement of cultivars. L. cicera and L. sativus are low production cost legumes adapted to low rainfall environments and have considerable potential as good quality, cheap protein sources. As world demand for legume feed protein is likely to increase, due to increasing demand for animal food products, both L. cicera and L. sativus are crops that should be considered in regions with suitable environments.},

 abstract = {The results of a floristic research carried out in the â€œBosco di Maviglianoâ€ are reported, a Site of Community importance (SCI) which was proposed to preserve several temporary ponds with IsoÃ«tes as well as Quercus pubescens or Q. frainetto woods, a very rare vegetation in the Crati River Valley. Moreover, a mosaic of riparian woods, arid pastures, uncultivated lands, fields and damp meadows characterizes this area. The vascular flora consists of 602 taxa belonging to 367 genera and 91 families. 8 species and 4 subspecies have been reported for the first time for the Calabrian flora; 9 entities were no longer recorded or considered doubtful for the regional flora. Finally, 13 species pertaining to the regional Red Lists were found and 20 species have been proposed for next update of the list. The biological spectrum shows the prevalence of therophytes; nevertheless, the hemicryptophytes represent a great percentage. The Mediterranean-type is the prevailing chorological type, followed by Eurasiatic-type, which are related to the subhumid meso-Mediterranean climate as well as the vast expanse of woodlands. Several rare species for the Calabrian and Italian flora were found in this area. Especially, a new record of Cornucopiae cucullatum should be emphasized. More effective conservation measures against building and cutting of the trees should be adopted to preserve terrestrial quillwort communitiesâ€”a priority habitat according to the Directive 92/43/EECâ€”and thermophilous deciduous oak woods with relative peculiar flora. Vengono riportati i risultati di un'indagine sulla flora vascolare del SIC Bosco di Mavigliano. Il sito si caratterizza soprattutto per la presenza di querceti caducifogli sia a roverella che a farnetto e per gli ambienti umidi temporanei a IsoÃ«tes ss.pp. Si rinvengono anche ampie superfici interessate da prati aridi, incolti aridi, campi di cereali e boschi ripariali, che contribuiscono ad elevare notevolmente il numero delle entitÃ  censite. Nel complesso, vengono elencati 602 taxa, riuniti in 91 famiglie e 367 generi. 8 specie e 4 sottospecie risultano nuove per la flora calabrese, mentre 9 entitÃ  non si rinvenivano da lungo tempo, oppure erano state considerate dubbie per la flora regionale. Infine, sono state rilevate 13 specie giÃ  inserite nelle Liste Rosse regionali, mentre altre 20 specie vengono proposte per un loro prossimo aggiornamento. Lo spettro biologico mette in evidenza la prevalenza delle terofite, ma anche le emicriptofite sono presenti con una percentuale notevole. Il tipo corologico predominante Ã¨ il Mediterraneo, seguito dall'Eurasiatico, da mettere in relazione con il clima mesomediterraneo subumido e con le tipologie di vegetazione forestale dominanti. Il SIC risulta indubbiamente meritevole di protezione, non solo per la presenza di habitat considerati di interesse prioritario ai sensi della Direttiva CEE/43/92, ma anche perchÃ© custode di alcune specie che risultamo molto rare per la flora calabrese ed italiana in generale. Viene sottolineato, in particolare, il ritrovamento di una stazione di Cornucopiae cucullatum, che rappresenta la seconda segnalazione per l'Italia. La recente espansione edilizia e il progressivo taglio del bosco, in particolare di alcuni esemplari monumentali di roverella, potrebbero vanificare i tentativi di recupero e salvaguardia dell'intero biotopo.},

 abstract = {Peas are grown worldwide as either dry peas used for human or animal consumption or as fresh, processing peas. One particular characteristic of pea agronomy that has implications for disease management is that peas are usually the first crop sown in spring and thus are often planted into cold and wet soils. Peas are affected by a number of bacterial, fungal, viral, and nematode diseases. These diseases, under the right conditions, can significantly decrease both yield and quality. In this chapter we divide pea diseases broadly into soilborne, airborne and viral diseases, a convenient classification when it comes to managing these different diseases. Important groups of organisms causing soilborne diseases on pea include fungi, bacteria, and nematodes. Soilborne fungal diseases discussed in this chapter include seedling diseases, root rots and wilts. The pea cyst, the root knot and the root-lesion nematodes cause soilborne nematode diseases. Fungi and bacteria cause major foliar diseases of pea. Foliar diseases caused by fungal pathogens include white mold, powdery mildew, downy mildew and Ascochyta blight. Important bacterial diseases include bacterial blight as well as brown spot. Finally, major diseases caused by viruses include Alfalfa mosaic virus, Bean leafroll virus, Pea enation mosaic virus, Pea streak virus, Red clover vein mosaic virus and Pea seedborne mosaic virus.},

 abstract = {Seven field and 5 glasshouse experiments were done during 1994â€“98 to
determine the relative susceptibilities and sensitivities of a wide range of
alternative annual pasture, forage, and crop legumes to infection with isolate
MI of bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV). Seed harvested from some species was
also tested for seed transmission of the virus. Seven of 18 genotypes
belonging to 17 species of annual pasture and forage legumes evaluated in 2
replicated field experiments were ranked as highly susceptible to BYMV, 7 as
susceptible, 2 as moderately resistant, 1 as resistant, and 1 as highly
resistant. The most susceptible and sensitive were
Biserrula pelecinus,
Trifolium cherleri, T. incarnatum,
and T. spumosum.
Ornithopus sativus was resistant but sensitive, whereas
Hedysarum coronarium was highly resistant.
H. coronarium was not infected when manually inoculated
repeatedly with 3 different BYMV isolates. Seventy-three of the 94 genotypes
of 7 crop legume species tested in the same replicated field experiments were
ranked as highly susceptible, including 58/68 of
Lens culinaris. Of the remaining genotypes, 6 were
susceptible, 5 moderately resistant, 9 resistant, and 1 highly resistant. Five
other crop legumes were included in other field experiments in which these
species were ranked as highly susceptible (1) or resistant (4). Overall, the
most susceptible and sensitive crop legume species were
Lens culinaris (most genotypes),
Lathyrus cicera, L. ochrus, and
Vicia narbonensis.
Lathyrus sativus (3 genotypes only),
V. sativa (4 genotypes),
Cicer arietinum, Pisum sativum,
and V. faba were resistant to isolate MI, and
Lens culinaris ILL7163 was highly resistant. When
infected, C. arietinum was ranked as highly sensitive
but symptoms within the other resistant crop species varied in sensitivity
between genotypes. Extreme resistance was confirmed in
Lens culinaris ILL7163 when it was manually and
aphid-inoculated repeatedly with 3 different BYMV isolates.
When testing seedlings for seed transmission of BYMV, germination on moist
paper towels before testing usually proved more effective than growing in soil
in the glasshouse. Low rates of seed transmission of BYMV
(0.03â€“1%) were detected in 9 alternative pasture or forage and 3
alternative crop legume species. This is the first report of seed transmission
of BYMV in these species. The pasture or forage species with the highest seed
transmission rates were T. clypeatum and
T. spumosum (both 1%). The crop legume species in
which seed transmission was found were L. cicera
(0.1%), L. sativus (0.2%), and
V. sativa (0.5%).
The high susceptibility and sensitivity to BYMV in some alternative annual
pasture, forage, and crop legumes is a cause for concern, especially when they
are intended for sowing in BYMV-prone high rainfall zones. Seed transmission
of BYMV also leads to inadvertent introduction of the virus to new sites.},

 abstract = {Seeds provide more than half of the world's intake of dietary protein and energy and thus are of immense economic, cultural and nutritional importance. Proteins can account for up to 40% of the dry weight of various types of seeds, thereby making a large contribution to the nutritional quality and processing properties of seeds. It is, therefore, not surprising that seed proteins were among the first plant components to be systematically studied, some 250 years ago, and have been a major focus of research over the past 100 years. The properties and behaviour of seed proteins pervade modem life in numerous ways. For example, legume and cereal proteins are used'in the production of a wide range of meat-free foods; the process of bread-making is dep~ndent on the physical chemical properties of wheat seed proteins; and in developed, as well as developing, countries, nutritional deficiencies among vegetarian diets are avoided through balancing legume and cereal seeds as sources of dietary proteins. Understanding seed proteins, in order to improve their composition and properties and to increase their concentrations, will thus continue to be an important research objective for the future. The present volume represents the culmination of a long-discussed plan of the editors, to bring together the best international authorities in order to compile a definitive monograph on biological, biochemical, molecular and genetic aspects of seed proteins.},

 abstract = {The most important cool season grain legumes with a Mediterranean origin are chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.), lentil (Lens culinaris subsp. culinaris Medikus), lupins (Lupinus sp.) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.). Their association with Rhizobium and the resulting biological nitrogen fixation reduces the demand for inorganic nitrogen fertiliser in the cropping system and produces high protein seed. As a result, they are widely grown as break crops in cereal-based systems. The uses of these grain legumes in the diet and as feed are highly diverse. Equally diverse, as the preceding chapters illustrate, is the Mediterranean environment, within which the ancestors of the various grain legume crops are found in different, often allopathic, ecological habitats. This diversity in habitat has led to contrasting adaptation among species and to a suite of different legume options for farming systems. Partly as a consequence, the cool-season grain legume crops have spread widely from their Mediterranean origins. Some crops, such as lupins, are of major importance in other areas with a Mediterranean climate such as Southern Australia. Others are important in markedly different climates such as chickpea and lentil in the Indian sub-continent and faba bean in China. The field pea is a gift from the Near East to the rest of the world, as dry pea is now barely consumed in West Asia.},

The optical properties of anthocyanins may serve as visual signals to potential herbivores, indicating a strong metabolic investment in toxic or unpalatable chemicals. Anthocyanins have also been implicated in the camouflage of plant parts against their backgrounds, in the undermining of insect crypsis, and in the mimicry of defensive structures. These hypotheses have in recent years attracted strong theoretical support and increasing experimental evidence.

 abstract = {Several Lathyrus species and in particular Lathyrus sativus (grass pea) have great agronomic potential as grain and forage legume, especially in drought conditions. Grass pea is rightly considered as one of the most promising sources of calories and protein for the vast and expanding populations of drought-prone and marginal areas of Asia and Africa. It is virtually the only species that can yield high protein food and feed under these conditions. It is superior in yield, protein value, nitrogen fixation, and drought, flood and salinity tolerance than other legume crops. Lathyrus species have a considerable potential in crop rotation, improving soil physical conditions; reducing the amount of disease and weed populations, with the overall reduction of production costs. Grass pea was already in use in Neolithic times, and presently is considered as a model crop for sustainable agriculture. As a result of the little breeding effort invested in it compared to other legumes, grass pea cultivation has shown a regressive pattern in many areas in recent decades. This is due to variable yield caused by sensitivity to diseases and stress factors and above all, to the presence of the neurotoxin Î²-N-oxalyl-L-Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid (Î²-ODAP), increasing the danger of genetic erosion. However, both L. sativus and L. cicera are gaining interest as grain legume crops in Mediterranean-type environments and production is increasing in Ethiopia, China, Australia and several European countries.This paper reviews research work on Lathyrus breeding focusing mainly on biotic and abiotic resistance improvement, and lists current developments in biotechnologies to identify challenges for Lathyrus improvement in the future.},

It also covers variations in germination responses of seeds from different populations of the same species. Environmental factors are known to influence the mother plant, thereby causing changes in the germination characteristics of the progeny (seeds). However, the kinds of changes that can occur in seeds, as they develop under varying environmental conditions, also need to be considered. The chapter illustrates seed polymorphism, and cleistogamous or chasmogamous seeds representing interplay of genetics, environment, and genetics X environmental factors along with a discussion of their consequences on seedling recruitment. It explores the reasons for variation in seed dormancy breaking and germination requirements within a species. Genetics and the environment of the mother plant during the time of seed maturations are two most important factors controlling this variation. Thus, research is often required to determine the relative importance of each of these two factors in the variation in seed dormancy and germination of a particular species.},

 abstract = {In recent years, knowledge of anthocyanin pigments has undergone unprecedented expansion. Indeed, the molecular genetic control of anthocyanin biosynthesis is now one of the best understood of all secondary metabolic pathways. Advances in analytical technology have led to the discovery of many novel anthocyanin compounds, dramatically enriching the palette used by plant breeders to introduce vibrant new colors into horticultural crops. The food industry, too, has benefited from this research; methods for stabilizing the colors of anthocyanins extracted from cell cultures have been optimized, opening the way for their use as natural food colorings. Recent scientific research has also focused on the possible benefits to human health from the ingestion of anthocyanin-rich foods. Anthocyanins are remarkably potent antioxidants. These pigments, especially in conjunction with other flavonoids, have been associated with reductions in the incidence and severity of many other non-infectious diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Finally, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the benefits of anthocyanins to plants themselves. Originally considered an extravagance without a purpose, anthocyanins are now implicated in multifarious vital functions. These include the attraction of pollinators and frugivores, defense from herbivores, and protection from environmental stressors. Anthocyanins are highly versatile and enormously useful to plants. This book covers the biosynthesis and function of anthocyanins (and the related proanthocyanidins) in plants, and their applications in agriculture, food products, and human health. The book addresses wide-ranging issues that include human nutrition, the pastoral sector, cell culture production systems, food colorants, flower and fruit color, plant biotic interactions, and the responses of plants to environmental stress. Kevin Gould is an Associate Professor in Biological Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, where he teaches plant development and physiological plant ecology. He has a long-standing research interest in the functional significance of anthocyanins in leaves, stems and roots. Chris Winefield is a Senior Lecturer in Plant Biotechnology and Biochemistry at Lincoln University, New Zealand, where he teaches plant biochemistry and biotechnology applications in modern plant biology. He has a long-standing research interest in the metabolism and molecular biology of plant secondary metabolites, especially the production of anthocyanins in ornamental flower crops. Latterly he has begun work characterizing metabolic pathways responsible for the formation of flavor and aroma compounds in wine grape. Kevin Davies leads the Plant Pigments Team of Crop & Food Research, Palmerston North, New Zealand. His group studies the molecular genetics of pigment biosynthesis in ornamentals, fruit and vegetables. A particular interest is the transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis.},

 abstract = {When introduced to the human body, bioactive metabolites produced by plants for self defense bind to particular biochemical targets, most notably to proteins involved in signaling by hormones and neurotransmitters. This, essentially, is the basis for the effects of herbal medicine. While herbal medicine preparations may act by complex synergistic interactions, molecular explanations of herbal medicine efficacy and side effects ultimately require definition of the biochemical targets of individual plant bioactive constituents. Biochemical Targets of Plant Bioactive Compounds is a comprehensive and user-friendly reference guide to biochemical targets of plant defensive compounds. With 500 pages of tables, it presents a mine of succinctly summarized information relating to bioactive compound structures, plant sources, biochemical targets and physiological effects that can be readily accessed via chemical compound, plant genus, plant common name and subject indexes. With introductory chapters providing reviews of the structural diversity of plant defensive compounds and biochemistry, this book is an invaluable reference for biomedical professionals in the fields of alternative/complementary medicine, natural product chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, and botany.},

 abstract = {Although yield and total biomass produced by annual legumes remain major objectives for breeders, other issues such as environment-friendly, resource use efficiency including symbiotic performance, resilient production in the context of climate change, adaptation to sustainable cropping systems (reducing leaching, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide residues), adaptation to diverse uses (seeds for feed, food, non-food, forage or green manure) and finally new ecological services such as pollinator protection, imply the need for definition of new ideotypes and development of innovative genotypes to enhance their commercialization. Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers. The cultivar structures are likely to be more complex, combining genotypes, plant species and associated symbionts. New tools to build and evaluate them are important if legumes are to deliver their exciting potential in terms of agricultural productivity and sustainability as well as for feed and food.},

 abstract = {Synthetic carbohydrate ligands â€“ also widely known as glycopolymers â€“ are known to undergo numerous recognition events when interacting with their corresponding lectins. Interactions are greatly enhanced due to the multivalent character displayed by the large number of repeating carbohydrate units along the polymers (pendant glycopolymers); therefore, resulting what is called the â€œglycocluster effectâ€. Moreover, the strength and the availability of these multivalent recognitions can be tuned via the architecture of the glycopolymers. Hence, understanding the mechanistic interactions between the types of lectins (plant, animal, toxin and bacteria) with their synthetic ligands is crucial. This review focuses on the synthesis of pendant glycopolymers via various synthetic pathways (free radical polymerization, NMP, RAFT, ATRP, cyanoxyl mediated polymerization, ROP, ROMP and post-polymerization modification) and their interactions with their respectively lectins.},

There was no difference in the total Et between grain legumes at either site in either year. There was also no variation in soil water extraction between species on the shallow sandy loam soil at Merredin. However, C. arietinum, L. sativus and L. cicera had greater water extraction and P. sativum the least water extraction at Mullewa where soil conditions were less hostile and root penetration was not restricted. The pattern of water use varied markedly between the grain legume species examined. Grain yield was positively correlated with post-flowering water use (Etpa) in both erect (r=0.59) and prostrate (r=0.54) grain legume species. Water use efficiencies for dry matter production (WUEdm) of up to 30 kg haâˆ’1 mmâˆ’1 for V. faba and V. narbonensis at Merredin, and water use efficiencies for grain yield (WUEgr) of up to 16 kg haâˆ’1 mmâˆ’1 for P. sativum and 13 kg haâˆ’1 mmâˆ’1 for V. faba at Mullewa, were comparable to those reported for cereals and other grain legumes in previous studies in this and other environments. Potential transpiration efficiencies (TE) of 15 kg haâˆ’1 mmâˆ’1 together with soil evaporation (Es) values of 100â€“125 mm were estimated in this and associated studies, and can be used as benchmark values to assess the yield potential of cool season grain legume crops in low rainfall Mediterranean-type environments. The major traits of adaptation for grain legume species producing large yields in this short season environment are early flowering, and pod and seed set before the onset of terminal drought. Early phenology together with rapid ground cover and dry matter production allows greater water use in the post flowering period. This leads to greater partitioning of dry matter into seed, which is reflected in greater harvest index (HI) and WUEgr, as was observed for V. faba and P. sativum. Improvement in the adaptation of other grain legume species to short season Mediterranean-type environments requires increased early growth for rapid ground cover and improved tolerance to low temperatures (especially for C. arietinum) during flowering and podding.},

Narbon grain yield averages around 1 tonne per hectare, with some lines yielding up to 3 tonnes in dry and low input systems. Therefore, narbon bean has a large potential to be used in Southern Spain for grain production in rainfed conditions. However, crop response is different on broomrape-infested soils where narbon yield can be greatly reduced or even eliminated. Materials with genetic resistance-tolerance are available and would be a good alternative for cropping in broomrape-infested areas.},

 abstract = {Sustainable agriculture is a rapidly growing field aiming at producing food and energy in a sustainable way for humans and their children. Sustainable agriculture is a discipline that addresses current issues such as climate change, increasing food and fuel prices, poor-nation starvation, rich-nation obesity, water pollution, soil erosion, fertility loss, pest control, and biodiversity depletion. Novel, environmentally-friendly solutions are proposed based on integrated knowledge from sciences as diverse as agronomy, soil science, molecular biology, chemistry, toxicology, ecology, economy, and social sciences. Indeed, sustainable agriculture decipher mechanisms of processes that occur from the molecular level to the farming system to the global level at time scales ranging from seconds to centuries. For that, scientists use the system approach that involves studying components and interactions of a whole system to address scientific, economic and social issues. In that respect, sustainable agriculture is not a classical, narrow science. Instead of solving problems using the classical painkiller approach that treats only negative impacts, sustainable agriculture treats problem sources. Because most actual society issues are now intertwined, global, and fast-developing, sustainable agriculture will bring solutions to build a safer world. This book series gathers review articles that analyze current agricultural issues and knowledge, then propose alternative solutions. It will therefore help all scientists, decision-makers, professors, farmers and politicians who wish to build a safe agriculture, energy and food system for future generations.},

 abstract = {It is open to question whether there is any difference between pasture and forage legumes. In the literature the terms are often used interchangeably and thus the distinction has become somewhat blurred. For the purpose of this discussion the term â€œforagesâ€ will apply to plant species that are cultivated and harvested for animal feed and are utilized or conserved within or at the end of the growing season. Vicia saliva (vetches), Lathyrus species and Medicago saliva are legumes that are used in this way. By contrast we will define â€˜pasturesâ€™ as systems used for grazing that remain established beyond one growing season. These include natural pastures and those that are established within the context of an agricultural system and rely on natural regeneration for annual production. Both types of pastures generally involve a mixture of species. A good quality pasture, however, will usually have a high legume component. For example, in southern Australia, commercial varieties of Trifolium spp. and Medicago spp. are purposely introduced into a farming system, which relies on the legume component to regenerate, from dormant seeds, during the fallow phase of a cereal cropping / animal production enterprise (Puckridge and French, 1983).},

 abstract = {Many components of cell and nuclear size and mass are correlated with nuclear DNA content in plants, as also are the durations and rates of such developmental processes as mitosis and meiosis. It is suggested that the multiple effects of the mass of nuclear DNA which affect all cells and apply throughout the life of the plant can together determine the minimum generation time for each species. The durations of mitosis and of meiosis are both positively correlated with nuclear DNA content and, therefore, species with a short minimum generation time might be expected to have a shorter mean cell cycle time and mean meiotic duration, and a lower mean nuclear DNA content, than species with a long mean minimum generation time. In tests of this hypothesis, using data collated from the literature, it is shown that the mean cell cycle time and the mean meiotic duration in annual species is significantly shorter than in perennial species. Furthermore, the mean nuclear DNA content of annual species is significantly lower than for perennial species both in dicotyledons and monocotyledons. Ephemeral species have a significantly lower mean nuclear DNA content than annual species. Among perennial monocotyledons the mean nuclear DNA content of species which can complete a life cycle within one year (facultative perennials) is significantly lower than the mean nuclear DNA content of those which cannot (obligate perennials). However, the mean nuclear DNA content of facultative perennials does not differ significantly from the mean for annual species. It is suggested that the effects of nuclear DNA content on the duration of developmental processes are most obvious during its determinant stages, and that the largest effects of nuclear DNA mass are expressed at times when development is slowest, for instance, during meiosis or at low temperature. It has been suggested that DNA influences development in two ways, directly through its informational content, and indirectly by the physical-mechanical effects of its mass. The term 'nucleotype' is used to describe those conditions of the nucleus which effect the phenotype independently of the informational content of the DNA. It is suggested that cell cycle time, meiotic duration, and minimum generation time are determined by the nucleotype. In addition, it may be that satellite DNA is significant in its nucleotypic effects on developmental processes.},

 abstract = {Very little nitrogen (N) fertiliser is applied to wheat crops in Australia. Currently, about 105 t of N fertiliser (less than 20% of Australia's total consumption) are used annually at an average rate of 2-3 kg Nha. This scant use of N fertiliser over much of the Australian wheat belt N is because the N derived from a legume-dominant pasture ley is thought to provide a wheat crop's N requirement. However, trends in the grain protein content of Australian wheat and some other indices of soil fertility suggest that legume-based pastures have not always been able to supply all the N required for adequate nutrition of the wheat crop and that there has been some occasional need for extra N from applications of fertiliser. Recent declines in the productivity and quality of pastures has further increased the need for supplementary applications of N fertiliser. The increase in grain legume production also has been partly based on the presumption that grain legumes contribute to the N economy of the following wheat crop. Many experiments throughout the wheat belt show a yield advantage of wheat grown after a grain legume, but these rotation trials also show that the level of productivity of the grain legume has little effect on the yield of the following wheat crop. A review of these experiments suggests that grain legumes, directly, contribute little to the N nutrition of a following wheat crop and their benefit may be from the legume acting as a disease break or providing the opportunity to control grassy weeds.},

 abstract = {The germplasm collections at ICARDA of faba bean, chickpea, lentil and forage legumes have been exploited by breeding programmes in the West Asia and North Africa region for production of improved cultivars. The first lines distributed were taken directly from the germplasm collections after initial evaluation. This formed the first flush of releases by national programmes, with 56 of 106 cultivars emanating from germplasm.A systematic evaluation of the food legumes for a wide range of morpho-agronomic characters based on the IBPGR/ICARDA descriptors has led to publication and widespread distribution of catalogues which, in turn, have led to an extensive use of the germplasm by national breeding programmes. In the period of 1990â€“1994, more than 5000 accessions of food legumes and more than 1900 accessions of forage legumes have been distributed per year.The most important use made of the germplasm collections has been their exploitation as a source for resistances and tolerances to biotic and abiotic stresses. These legumes often suffer severe yield loss due to disease and environmental stress; consequently, screening procedures were developed for the major biotic and abiotic stresses and were successfully applied in selecting sources of resistances and tolerances.The germplasm collections have also been used to improve the nutritional quality of these crops, both for human and animal consumption. Most of the food legume collections have been screened for protein content. The Lathyrus spp. collections have yielded lines with low levels of the neurotoxin ODAP (Î²-N-Oxalyl-L-Î±,Î²-Diaminopropionic Acid), which causes Lathyrism in humans and animals. These lines are being used extensively in the breeding programme.In addition to maintaining collections of the cultigens, ICARDA has also assembled large collections of wild relatives and progenitors of lentil and chickpea; and wild and weedy forms of the forage legume species. In the past five years the wild Lens and Cicer collections have been evaluated for resistances to biotic and abiotic stresses. These have been useful in providing sources of new, improved or multiple-stress resistance. They have also been useful in increasing yield potential and adaptation of the cultigens.},

 abstract = {Da osservazioni, raccolte e appunti presi in molti anni nei dintorni di Viareggio, specialmente quando l'intervento antropico era ancora limitato, Ã¨ scaturito questo materiale per la flora e la vegetazione versiliese, nel settore tra il Serchio a S e il Cinquale a N. Il territorio fa parte di quella antica piana lagunare delle foci Arno-Serchio le cui vicende geofisiche sono state giÃ  descritte dai CORTI nel suo lavoro su S. Rossore. Maggiormente studiate sono le due selve (Â«pineteÂ») che racchiudevano Viareggio, fino alla spiaggia con dune e acquitrini interdunali, ma anche il retroterra paludoso fino al lago di Massaciuccoli, ove si annidano tuttora relitti microtermici come Drosera rotundifolia, Peucedanum palustre, Euphorbia palustris, Viburnum opulus, etc. (restainvece esclusa dalla descrizione la Â«macchia di MigliarinoÂ», che probabilmente Ã¨ anche soggetta a un sottoclima differente, piÃ¹ Â«mediterraneoÂ»). Nell'interno delle selve, che oggi hanno l'aspetto prevalente di pinete antropiche a Pinus pinea, P. pinaster e Quercus ilex (il quale non sembra qui rappresentativo della Â«flora mediterraneaÂ»), vi sono fascie relitte delle antiche cenosi igrofile di depressione interdunale a Fraxinus excelsior s. l., Rhamnus frangula, Alnus glutinosa, Periploca graeca, etc. che costituiscono insigni avanzi delle primitive selve litoranee a Quercus pedunculata, conservatisi in virtÃ¹ di una ricca falda freatica permanente e di un clima meso-igrico e relativamente microtermico conseguente alla posizione geografica della Versilia, situata alle falde dell'imponente e molto piovoso massiccio delle Alpi Apuane. Una fascia peniclimatica attuale Ã¨ anche quella a Hedera, Ficus, Populus alba, Rubus, etc., che richiama certi aspetti delle foreste pluviali. Nelle zonule di suolo emergente entro la pineta Â«di ponenteÂ», ove cioÃ¨ la superficie Ã¨ piÃ¹ o meno distanziata dalla falda acquea, sono insediate tracce notevoli di una brughiera a Molinia coerulea, Calluna, Ericae, Potentilla erecta, Peucedanum oreoselinum e Ulex. Nella selva Â«di levanteÂ» cenosi a Carex punctata e Lastrea thelypteris marcano un aspetto particolare dei margini acquitrinosi. L'elenco floristico comprende tutti i taxa (867) finora noti per il settore. Da un confronto con il settore adiacente di S. Rossore (CORTI) emergono interessanti differenze floristiche: Viareggio appare piÃ¹ microtermico, in relazione con il crescente influsso delle Alpi Apuane sulla ecologia della pianura litoranea, man mano che si va verso il N; e infatti il settore versiliese Ã¨ l'ultimo lembo N del litorale planiziario tirrenico, ma decisamente diverso dalla Â«maremmaÂ» della quale tende qui a sfumare anche la caratteristica Â«macchia mediterraneaÂ», di cui alcuni peculiari elementi terminano probabilmente a S. Rossore (come il termoigrofilo Vitex agnus-castus). Anche le cenosi erbacee di spiaggia sono notevolmente differenti da quelle degli are-nili maremmani, di cui mancano in Versilia le specie piÃ¹ termo-xerofile. Risultano invece identici a Viareggio e a S. Rossore gli spettri biologici di RAUNKIAER, con emicrittofite e terofite quasi equilibrate. Interessanti considerazioni derivano anche dal confronto con la flora pontina (BÃ‰GUINOT) e con quella del comprensorio ravennate (ZANGHERI). Raggruppando i taxa secondo i loro areali generali, si trova anche a Viareggio, come a S. Rossore, una forte pereentuale (30%) di piante piÃ¹ o meno Â«borealiÂ», e invece uno scarso tasso di piante Â«mediterraneeÂ», ancor piÃ¹ basso che a S. Rossore. CiÃ² marca il carattere precipuo della vegetazione viareggina, che Ã¨ probabilmente la meno Â«mediterraneaÂ» e la piÃ¹ Â«borealeÂ» tra quelle del litorale tirrenico, come del resto emerge anche dalla paritÃ  di percentuale fra emicrittofite e terofite nello spettro biologico, il quale, per esser rilevato sopra un litorale mediterraneo, dovrebbe avere una prevalenza di terofite. Scarsissimo il componente orientale; notevole invece quello occidentale, con Ulex europaeus Â«atlanticoÂ» e moite specie da annoverarsi fra le Â«subatlanticheÂ», t ra cui Hydrocotyle vulgaris, H. ranunculoides, Ludwigia palustri, Hibiscus palustris, etc. Endemismo scarsissimo, probabilmente a causa della incostanza del suolo che fu soggetto a susseguirsi di trasgressioni marine. Notevolissimo invece il relittualismo, da antiche florule microtermiche riaffluite, dopo l'ultima regressione, dagli acquitrini della vicina valle dell'Arno ove il fenomeno Ã¨ piÃ¹ cospicuo come ci mostrano gli studi di FRANCINI, PICHI-SERMOLLI, TONGIORGI, etc. Clima caratterizzato da costante umiditÃ  dell'aria (oltre quella del suolo) e da bassa escursione termica, favorevole dunque alle specie Â«policoreÂ», che vi sono infatti in gran numero, e all'avvento di specie esotiche delle quali una moltitudine si Ã¨ naturalizzata in Versilia. Nel ribadire le molte considerazioni fatte dal CORTI per S. Rossore, si insiste sulia opportunitÃ  e sulla urgenza di salvaguardare la vegetazione dell'intero settore pisano-versiliese, sia per l'importanza che essa ha dal lato scientifico, sia per il suo gran valore salutare, estetico ed economico.},

The comparison among these investigations reveals the rich plant colonisation, due to the great variety of habitats present in the monument and to its state of abandon. The maximum peak of 418 species can be referred in Deakin's list, and the minimum are the current 242 species, mainly distributed in the hypogeans. The total amount of colonising species in time was 684 vascular plants. The species listed for the monument in all the studies are 135, and all the common ones are 192. These are mainly herbaceous plants of ruderal habitats, widely distributed in more or less nitrophylous pastures or pioneer on rocks and walls. 426 species were enumerated before the XX century and later disappeared from the places. 117 species no longer belong to the Roman flora, and 24 species are no longer listed in the regional flora. These were mainly herbaceous and woody species typical of dynamically developed stages, belonging to forest and border line communities. Typical species of very disturbed habitats are also frequent. 66 species were collected only in more recent times. These belong to the synanthropic flora, though less nitrophylous compared with the previous, or are cultivated plants capable of becoming spontaneous under favourable conditions. The comparison among the different floras indicates not only the change in use of the monument, but also that climatic and microclimatic changes occurred in the last centuries. The relative biological and chorological spectra confirm the progressive warming and average reduction of humidity of the site.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Lathyrus genus includes 160 species, some of which have economic importance as food, fodder and ornamental crops (mainly L. sativus, L. cicera and L. odoratus, respectively) and are cultivated in >1Â·5 Mha worldwide. However, in spite of their well-recognized robustness and potential as a source of calories and protein for populations in drought-prone and marginal areas, cultivation is in decline and there is a high risk of genetic erosion.
SCOPE: In this review, current and past taxonomic treatments of the Lathyrus genus are assessed and its current status is examined together with future prospects for germplasm conservation, characterization and utilization. A particular emphasis is placed on the importance of diversity analysis for breeding of L. sativus and L. cicera.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts for improvement of L. sativus and L. cicera should concentrate on the development of publicly available joint core collections, and on high-resolution genotyping. This will be critical for permitting decentralized phenotyping. Such a co-ordinated international effort should result in more efficient and faster breeding approaches, which are particularly needed for these neglected, underutilized Lathyrus species.},

 abstract = {Legumes are an important source of protein for humans and animals. They provide nutritionally rich crop residues for animal feed, and playa key role in maintaining the productivity of soils particularly through biological nitroÂ­ gen fixation. They are, therefore, of immense value in rainfed farming systems. The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) has a responsibility for research on food, pasture, and forage legumes. The Center also has the broad objective of improving livestock production in rainfed farming systems. Although food legumes have be~n known and grown by farmers in the WANA region for a long time, their productivity has remained low and variable. Forage legumes, on the other hand, are not so well known by farmers of the region, and their role in the farming systems is not so well understood. Thus, we need to develop the concept of using forage legumes as crops and to fit them into cropping systems. In its efforts to increase the productivity of food legumes and develop the legume-based crop/livestock systems, ICARDA has established a network of scientists in the different National Agricultural Research Systems in the region. To further strengthen this network, ICARDA convened a workshop on 'The Role of Legumes in the Farming Systems of Mediterranean Areas' in Tunis, Tunisia, 20-24 June 1988. This workshop was co-sponsored by UNDP, who also contributed funds for this publication.},

Bl.A phytogeographical analysis of the weed flora has revealed the great proportion of East-Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian species among the segetals of Palestine.A series of obligatory weeds occuring in Mediterranean Palestine recur as components of primary associations in the neighbouring steppes and deserts, whence they obviously came to the segetal habitat.A series of other obligatory weeds endemic to Palestine or to Palestine and Syria have as yet not been found in primary habitats.There is some evidence for the assumption that many widespread weeds at present not found in primary habitats are to be considered components of â€œnew-landâ€ associations, i.e. pioneer associations colonizing bare lands formed through denudation or spill etc. These plants have no doubt existed ever since and with the artificial formation of new land by man have occupied the segetal habitats as permanent sites.While certain segetal associations (Prosopidetum, Eragrostis â€” Centaurea association) continue to exist on the spot long after cultivation has ceased and so to delay the return of primary vegetation, other associations (Ononis â€” Carthamus association, Achilleetum, Leopoldia â€” Lolium association) readily disappear from abandoned fields and clear the way for local climax vegetation or seral associations preceding the climax.},

At the most favourable site, grain yields were up to 1.6, 2.6 and 1.7 t/ha for L. sativus, L. cicera and L. ochrus respectively, compared with a field pea grain yield of 3.1 t/ha. There was considerable genotype and environmental variation in ODAP concentration in the seed. On average, the ODAP concentration of L. ochrus (6.58 mg/g) was about twice that of L. sativus, and L. cicera had the lowest ODAP concentration (1.31 mg/g). Given that Lathyrus spp. have not had the same breeding effort as field pea and other grain legumes in Australia, these results encourage further selection or breeding. In the shor-tseasoned, mediterranean-type environment of Western Australia, harvest indices and grain yields could be improved with early flowering. Low ODAP concentration should also be sought.},

 abstract = {Grass pea offers an attractive choice for sustainable food production, owing to its intrinsic properties including limited water requirement and drought tolerance. However, low productivity and the presence of a neurotoxin (ODAP) have posed major obstacles to its genetic improvement. Also, biotechnological investments remain limited and the genome is complex and not well understood. Strategies that allow identification of genotypes with reduced ODAP content, coupling of low ODAP content with enhanced yield, and effective seed detoxification methods merit immediate attention. Breeder-friendly genomic tools are being increasingly made available to improve the efficiency of breeding protocols. To this end, the application of next-generation sequencing has provided a means of leveraging the repertoire of genomic resources for this somewhat neglected crop. In this review, we describe progress achieved in Lathyrus genetic improvement. We also explore potential opportunities in Lathyrus research and identify urgent research needs.},

 abstract = {Garden cultivation played an important role in early food production but the definition of a garden is often unclear and encompasses a variety of different cultivation methods. This paper explores the intensive cultivation of small plots using horticultural methods through an investigation of garden and field agriculture in the Greek island of Evvia. Evidence is presented to demonstrate that intensive cultivation practices, such as hoeing, weeding, manuring and watering, have a significant impact on soil and crop productivity and are most likely to be applied to areas located near to settlement. The implications of intensive, small-scale cultivation for settlement location, population mobility and land tenure in prehistory are then explored. For example, while an economic system dependent on cereal cultivation does not necessarily involve extensive land clearance or field systems, the investment in land inherent in intensive cultivation provides a strong incentive for remaining in the same place and repeatedly cultivating the same spot.},

 abstract = {Phase out of most chemicals available for weed management renewed the interest in soil solarization as a technically effective and environmentally safe practice for lettuce weed control in hot summer areas. Properties of solarizing films and lettuce crop system may considerably affect weed control and yield response of soil solarization. Different solarizing films, including low-density polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, low-density polyethyleneâ€“ethylene-vinyl acetate coextruded and a biodegradable corn starch-based film, were evaluated in 2003 and 2004 for weed control and lettuce yield response under field and greenhouse conditions in Southern Italy. Soil solarization strongly reduced weed density and biomass in both greenhouse and in the field, with no significant differences among the tested plastic films. Most annual weeds were completely controlled by soil solarization, except amaranth, Amaranthus spp., in soil solarized with biodegradable film in the field. Emergence of mediterranean sweetclover, Melilotus sulcatus, was stimulated by soil solarization in greenhouse. In the field, Cyprus vetch, Lathyrus ochrus, was found in solarized plots though absent in untreated soil. Perennial weeds were not affected by soil solarization, except a strong control of canadian thistle, Cirsium arvense, in the field. Lettuce yield resulted significantly higher in solarized soil than in control plots, with no significant differences among the solarizing materials. All tested materials proved to be technically effective for soil solarization in lettuce, though low resistance and short durability of biodegradable film may suggest its application mainly to soil solarization in greenhouse or in organic systems.},

Subsequently, work on nuclear genome size in flowering plant taxa, and interest in its consequences, has increased. Thus, estimates for 588 angiosperm species not previously listed were published, or communicated to us, between 1982 and mid-1986. As these additional estimates came from more than 50 sources which were either widely scattered in the scientific literature or unpublished personal communications, they are not readily accessible. This, and the many personal enquiries for the information received, shows that a further publication, compiling the new data is needed. This paper, therefore, contains a further supplementary list of absolute DNA amounts. This new compilation includes DNA C values for 629 angiosperm species not listed in either of the above-mentioned papers, with additional estimates for 119 species already listed by them. These data are assembled primarily for reference purposes. Analysis of citations of the two previously published lists and of personal requests for additional information both show that the major users of genome size information are cell and molecular biologists. Consequently, the species are listed as before in alphabetical order, rather than by any taxonomic scheme, as this was felt to be more helpful to these users },

The families with the highest numbers of species were Compositae, Gramineae, Leguminosae and Cruciferae. Therophytes represented 79% of the biological spectrum, with hemicryptophytes and geophytes more especially in the spring-sown crops. At the early and late crop growth stages about 4% and 8%, respectively, of the fields had severe or very severe infestations. The seasonality of the crop had a marked influence on the weed flora, mainly due to the relationship of its phenological cycle with well defined climatic periods and to soil management practices. Cluster analysis clearly differentiated typically autumn-spring and spring-summer floras as well as a set of common species.

 abstract = {Calcareous outcrops in North-Western Sardinia cover a large area (about 380 Km) known as â€œSassareseâ€. in this study the vascular flora of this area is investigated. The actual flora is checked and, when possible, older references, synonyms and critical notes are given. The floristic list includes 840 entities. Among them, 18 have been cultivated (cultae), 11 are considered erroneously reported and so they are excluded from this area (excludendae) and 81 are in various ways considered not confirmed and to enquiry (inquirendae). The current floristic contingent is therefore reduced to 730 entities, divided into 98 families and 385 genera, many of them here documented for the first time in this area. Among them the more relevant are the Sardinian-Corsican endemic Silene nodulosa Viv. and the Sardinian endemic Hieracium gallurense Arrigoni, previously reported only for granite substrata in North-Eastern Sardinia. The biological spectrum shows a clear dominance of therophytes (41%). The chorological spectrum highlights the dominance of the Tethydic element, in which the dominance of more strictly Mediterranean element emerges. Four entities have in this area their locus classicus: Centaurea corensis Valsecchi et Filigheddu, Limonium racemosum (Lojac.) Diana and Scrophularia morisii Valsecchi, exclusive of the region object of this study, and Ophrys sphegodes Mill. subsp. praecox Corrias. Some entities, though not endemic, have a limited or fragmentary distribution in Sardinia, e.g. Capparis spinosa L. subsp. rupestris (Sm.) Nyman, Coridothymus capi- tatus (L.) Reichenb. f. and Erica multiflora L., whereas Viola arborescens L. Borago pygmaea (DC.) Chater et Greuter and Carex panormitana Guss. are included in the Red Book of Italian Plants. Although the area is strongly urbanised and subjected since long time ago to agricultural and pastoral uses, its flora is still rather diversified. The presence of species depending on the existence of hedges, dry-stone walls and other smaller structures belonging to traditional agricultural activities still present, is also substantial, even though their dilapidated state is often high. Finally the presence of floristic elements of great interest together with small residuals of spontaneous vegetation are of very high value. indeed, several natural elements from traditionally agricultural activities are present within an area of intense anthropic impact. The indiscriminate building development of the valleys, the reckless exploitation of the water sources and the diffusion of dumps, threaten increasingly some habitats of the region. The improvement of the natural resources could be done through an adequate ecological net starting from a basic knowledge of the floristic biodiversity, that is the main aim of this work. Gli affioramenti calcarei miocenici della Sardegna Nord-occidentale occupano una superficie di circa 380 km, conosciuta come â€œSassareseâ€. Con questa ricerca si Ã¨ voluto dare un contributo alle conoscenze della flora di questo territorio. L'elenco floristico, che comprende 840 entitÃ , include: entitÃ  rinvenute nel corso di questa ricerca; entitÃ  rinvenute nello stesso territorio da altri autori in tempi recenti; entitÃ  rinvenute in epoche passate la cui presenza non Ã¨ stata confermata (inquirendae); entitÃ  indicate per il territorio per le quali si esclude invece la presenza (excludendae); entitÃ  coltivate in tipi di vegetazione seminaturali o che conferiscono un'impronta caratteristica al paesaggio (cultae); entitÃ  introdotte e, a vari livelli, ritenute spontaneizzate. Per le entitÃ  la cui presenza non Ã¨ stata confermata, si riportano in nota i riferimenti bibliografici e/o i campioni d'erbario sui quali si Ã¨ basata la segnalazione. Si ritiene che il contingente floristico attuale sia pari a 730 entitÃ , ripartite in 98 famiglie e 385 generi. Tra le entitÃ  segnalate per la prima volta nel territorio sono di particolare rilievo l'endemica sardo-corsa Silene nodulosa Viv. e l'endemica sarda Hieracium gallurense Arrigoni, precedentemente indicata esclusivamente per i substrati granitici della Sardegna Nord-orientale. Lo spettro biologico evidenzia una netta dominanza delle terofite, mentre quello corologico eveidenzia la dominanza dell'elemento Tetidico, nell'ambito del quale emerge l'elemento strettamente mediterraneo. Quattro entitÃ  endemiche hanno in questo territorio il loro locus classicus: Centaurea corensis Valsecchi et Filigheddu, Limonium racemosum (Lojac.) Diana e Scrophularia morisii Valsecchi, esclusive dell'area di studio, e Ophrys sphegodes Mill. subsp. praecox Corrias. Alcune entitÃ  rinvenute, quali Capparis spinosa L. subsp. rupestris (Sm.) Nyman, Coridothymus capitatus (L.) Reichenb., Laurus nobilis ed Erica multiflora L., hanno in Sardegna una distribuzione limitata o frammentaria e la loro presenza nel territorio del Sassarese Ã¨ quindi di particolare interesse. Nell'area sono presenti alcune entitÃ  incluse nel Libro rosso delle piante d'Italia: Viola arborescens L., Boragopygmaea (DC.) Chater et Greuter e Carexpanormitana Guss. Sebbene l'area indagata sia fortemente urbanizzata e sottoposta da lungo tempo all'utilizzo agro-pastorale la sua flora risulta fortemente diversificata e ancora ricca di entitÃ  significative dal punto di vista del loro areale di distribuzione generale o nell'ambito della Sardegna. Rilevante anche la presenza di specie legate alla presenza di siepi, muretti a secco e altri manufatti delle attivitÃ  agricole tradizionali ancora presenti nel territorio, sebbene in molti casi in situazione di degrado o di abbandono. L'elevato livello di biodiversitÃ  dell'area, la presenza di elementi floristici di pregio, di nuclei di vegetazione spontanea residua, piÃ¹ o meno estesi, di numerosi elementi lineari, naturali o derivanti dalle attivitÃ  agricole tradizionali, all'interno di un'area di forte impatto antropico dovrebbe essere motivo di tutela degli habitat oggi sempre piÃ¹ minacciati nel territorio dall'urbanizzazione selvaggia delle vallate, dall'utilizzo sconsiderato delle risorse idriche e dalla diffusione delle discariche e di valorizzazione delle risorse naturali anche attraverso la realizzazione di un'adeguata rete ecologica.},

Thus for the first time, an overview and assessment of biological invasions in the Pan-European region is finally possible. The Handbook of Alien Species in Europe summarises the major findings of this groundbreaking research and addresses the invasion trends, pathways, and both economic as well as ecological impact for eight major taxonomic groups. Approximately 11.000 alien species recorded in Europe are listed, and fact sheets for 100 of the most invasive alien species are included, each with a distribution map and colour illustration. The book is complemented by a regularly updated internet database providing free additional information. With its highly interdisciplinary approach, DAISIE and its Handbook will be the basis for future scientific investigations as well as management and control of alien invasive species in Europe.},

The aim was to use white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) and Andean lupin (L. mutabilis Sweet) as supporting crops, and intercrop them with nine other annual cool season legumes, as supported crops. The highest two-year average total forage dry matter yield obtained was for the intercrop of white lupin with grass pea (11.2thaâˆ’1). Intercropping white lupin with Ethiopian pea and French vetch had the highest two-year average values for land equivalent ratio (LER), given as LERFDMY (both 1.20). The highest two-year average total forage dry matter yield came from the intercrop of Andean lupin with grass pea (9.8thaâˆ’1). Intercropping Andean lupin with grass pea had the highest two-year average values of LERFDMY (1.10). The overall average obtained for intercropping white lupin with other cool season annual legumes was 10.3thaâˆ’1 of forage dry matter yield and LERFDMY of 1.15, while intercropping white lupin with other cool season annual legumes yielded 8.7thaâˆ’1 of forage dry matter and LERFDMY of 1.04. In comparison to the traditional approach of intercropping annual legumes with cereals for forage production, the mutual intercropping of annual legumes provides farmers with higher quality forage and grain richer in protein and better utilisation of natural resources.},

We included both agricultural field experiments and areas where â€˜traditionalâ€™ farming is practised. Our aim is to ground-truth interpretation of Î´15N values in archaeobotanical crop remains as evidence of past growing conditions and husbandry practices. The results confirm the potentially radical impact of manuring on Î´15N values in cereals, depending on manuring level, but indicate only a slight effect on pulses, which can fix atmospheric nitrogen. The expected geographical trend towards greater Î´15N with increasing climatic aridity is not apparent, probably because the growing conditions for crops are â€˜bufferedâ€™ through crop management. Each of these observations has fundamental implications for archaeobotanical interpretation of Î´15N values as evidence of land use practices and (together with analysis of bone collagen/tooth enamel in potential consumers) palaeodiet.},

Western Australia were inspected for plants with suspect virus symptoms over 4
growing seasons (1994, 1997, 1998, 1999), and plant samples were tested for
infection with alfalfa mosaic (AMV), bean yellow mosaic (BYMV), cucumber
mosaic (CMV), and pea seed-borne mosaic (PSbMV) viruses. All 4 viruses were
detected in faba bean (Vicia faba); BYMV, CMV, and PSbMV
in field pea (Pisum sativum); AMV, CMV, and PSbMV in
lentil (Lens culinaris); and AMV and CMV in chickpea
(Cicer arietinum). Among minor crop species, AMV, BYMV,
and CMV were found in narbon bean (V. narbonensis) and
grass pea (Lathyrus sativus); BYMV and CMV in dwarf
chickling (L. cicera); BYMV in bitter vetch
(V. e r v i l i a ) and
L. clymenum; and AMV in fenugreek
(Trigonella foenum-graecum). Incidences of individual
viruses varied widely from site to site but plot infection sometimes reached
100%. Symptom severity varied widely with virusâ€“crop combination.
In large-scale surveys of commercial crops of field pea and faba bean over 2
(1998, 1999) and 3 (1994, 1998, 1999) growing seasons, respectively, randomly
collected samples from each crop were tested for presence of AMV, BYMV, CMV,
and PSbMV. In 1999 they were also tested for beet western yellows virus
(BWYV). All 5 viruses were detected in both species. BWYV was found in
35% of faba bean and 56% of the field pea crops sampled in 1999,
with incidences of infection in individual crops up to 40% and
49%, respectively. PSbMV was found in 42% and BYMV in 18%
of field pea crops in 1999. In individual crops, highest infection incidences
of BYMV and PSbMV detected were 31% for BYMV in faba bean in 1998 and
9% for PSbMV in field pea in 1999. CMV and AMV incidences in both
species never exceeded 7% of crops or 4% of plants within
individual crops. Infection by 2 different viruses within individual crops was
common, even 3 were sometimes found. Cultivars infected with most viruses were
Fiesta and Fiord for faba bean, and Dundale, Laura, and Magnet for field pea.
BYMV was detected in the crop tested of dwarf chickling. In tests on seed
samples from Western Australia of 30 commercial seed stocks of field pea, 11
of faba bean, and 50 of chickpea, PSbMV was detected in 11, 1, and 1,
respectively; CMV in 1, 1, and 3; BYMV in 3, 1, and 0; and AMV in 0, 0, and 1.
This appears to be the first record of seed transmission of CMV in pea and
faba bean. Seed samples from Victoria were also found to contain viruses:
PSbMV in pea and AMV in lentil.
Widespread infection with viruses in evaluation plots and commercial crops of
cool season crop legumes is a cause for concern, especially where individual
crop incidences are high and 2 or more viruses are present. Sowing of infected
seed stocks leads to introduction of randomly dispersed sources of virus
infection within the crop sown, resulting in spread of infection and yield
losses. Appropriate control measures are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper explores the full potential of archaeobotanical research in the investigation of issues such as agricultural practices and resource management and mobilisation in shaping the social dynamics of Neolithic and Bronze Age Crete, through a synthesis for the first time of all available archaeobotanical information to date. To this body of data new information is added from six sites: Kephala Petras, Pryniatikos Pyrgos, Aghia Fotia, Knossos Little Palace North, Sissi and Zominthos. A comprehensive methodology is devised using three units of analysis to allow an in-depth study, firstly of the quality of the available dataset and secondly of its content. A total of 80 archaeobotanical records, compiled in one database, are examined in the light of the methods employed for their sampling, recovery and processing. The reliability of the current dataset is assessed, highlighting shortcomings; methodological issues are addressed to improve its quality. These records are then analysed according to their temporal, spatial and contextual distribution across the island. A synthesis of the full resource base, including cereals, legumes, fruits, nuts, condiments and wild species, is conducted, providing a contextualised picture of their availability and use, and identifying lacunae and interpretational potential. On these bases a research agenda is set and future research priorities and new approaches are suggested that place archaeobotany in the core of current archaeological discourse on social models, practices and meanings for prehistoric Crete.

 abstract = {Many plants contain carbohydrate-binding proteins that are commonly designated as lectins, agglutinins, or hemagglutinins. Due to the obvious differences in molecular structure, biochemical properties, and carbohydrate-binding specificity, plant lectins are usually considered a complex and heterogeneous group of proteins. Recent advances in the structural analysis of lectins and molecular cloning of lectin genes enable subdividision of plant lectins in a limited number of subgroups of structurally and evolutionary related proteins. Four major lectin families, namely, the legume lectins, the chitin-binding lectins composed of hevein domains, the type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins, and the monocot mannose-binding lectins comprise the majority of all currently known plant lectins. In addition to these four large families the jacalin-related lectins, the amaranthin family, and the Cucurbitaceae phloem lectins are now recognized as separate subgroups. Each of the above-mentioned lectin families is discussed in detail. The description of the individual lectin families includes (1) a brief historical note, (2) an overview of the occurrence, molecular structure, and primary structure of the lectins, (3) a detailed discussion of the structure of the gene(s) and the biosynthesis and posttranslational processing of the primary translation products, (4) a summary of carbohydrate-binding specificity, (5) if relevant a note on the occurrence of lectin-related proteins, (6) a description of the three-dimensional structure of the lectins and the protomers, (7) a detailed discussion of the molecular evolution, and (8) a critical assessment of the physiological role of each group of lectins. Lectins that cannot be classified into one of the seven groups are discussed separately. General conclusions about the structure, evolution, and function of plant lectins are summarized in the concluding remarks.},

 abstract = {Field and glasshouse experiments (3 of each) were done during 2003â€“06 to determine the responses of a range of genotypes belonging to 13 species of cool-season crop legumes to infection with Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV). Seed quality defects were determined and genotypes of some species were also tested for seed transmission of the virus. In field experiments, of 39 genotypes of field pea (Pisum sativum) evaluated, 15 were ranked as highly susceptible, 10 susceptible, 9 moderately resistant, and 5 resistant, while all 7 lupin species (Lupinus spp.) tested were resistant. In glasshouse sap and graft inoculations with PSbMV to genotypes not found infected in the field and 2 additional lupin species, no virus was detected in any of the 9 lupin species or in 5 field pea genotypes tested. Thus, the lupins all appeared to be non-hosts and the 5 field pea genotypes had resistance to the 2 PSbMV isolates used to inoculate them. All 14 genotypes of faba bean (Vicia faba) evaluated in the field were ranked highly susceptible, while 12 out of 16 lentil (Lens culinaris) genotypes were ranked as highly susceptible and 4 as susceptible. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) genotypes were moderately resistant (50) or susceptible (7). Once infected, plant sensitivities (symptom severities) ranged from low in some field pea and most lentil genotypes to high in most faba bean genotypes. Chickpea genotypes all were ranked as moderately sensitive. Seed lots harvested from PSbMV-infected plants of field pea, faba bean, and chickpea all showed severe seed quality defects, but lentil was usually less affected. The predominant seed symptoms were necrotic rings and line markings on the seed coat, malformation, reduced size, and splitting. Kabuli chickpea types also showed darkening of the seed coat. Seed transmission of PSbMV was detected in faba bean (0.2%) and field pea (5â€“30%). When PSbMV infection foci were introduced into plots of lentil cv. Nugget, the virus spread to the lentil plants and decreased shoot dry weight by 23%, seed yield by 96%, and individual seed weight by 58%. Seed transmission of PSbMV (6%) was detected in seed from the infected lentil plants. In a survey for possible viral seed symptoms, all seed lots of kabuli chickpea (5) and field pea (70), and 10 of 18 of faba bean were affected, but none of the 23 of lentil. When seedlings from 16 faba bean and 7 field pea seed lots were tested for 3 viruses, neither Broad bean stain virus nor Broad bean true mosaic virus was detected, but PSbMV was found in 5 field pea seed lots at incidences of <1â€“14%. PSbMV was detected in commercial field pea seed stocks of cvv. Kaspa (33) and Parafield (12) at incidences of 0.5â€“47% and 0.3â€“30%, respectively. The implications of these findings in terms of genotype susceptiblility and sensitivity to PSbMV infection and their importance for the management of PSbMV in legume crops are discussed.},

Among them, 11 (Avena sativa subsp. macrantha, A. sterilis subsp. ludoviciana, Chenopodium hybridum, Cuscuta campestris, Mentha arvensis, Rosa andegavensis, R. dumalis, Schedonorus uechtritzianus, Scrophularia umbrosa, Trifolium alexandrinum and Veronica catenata) are new for the Umbrian flora and 2 (Crypsis alopecuroides and Schedonorus uechtritzianus) for the Marchean flora. Numerous rare and threatened species in Umbrian and Marchean flora, such as Alopecurus bulbosus, Carex tomentosa, Equisetum fluviatile, Juncus hybridus, Nymphaea alba, Ophioglossum vulgatum, Ranunculus flammula, R. ophioglossifolius, Trifolium patens and Utricularia australis, have been found. Nevertheless some species, previously recorded for Palude di Colfiorito, such as Eriophorum latifolium, Hippuris vulgaris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Menyanthes trifoliata, Potamogeton lucens, P. trichoides, Ranunculus lingua and Triglochinpalustre, were not found and considered locally extinct. Gli â€œAltipiani di Colfioritoâ€ rappresentano un sistema di sette depressioni tettoniche, interessate da fenomeni carsici, situate nell'Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano (Italia). Tale area si contraddistingue per la presenza di zone umide che sono state protette a livello internazionale con l'individuazione di un'area tutelata dalla Convenzione di Ramsar, l'istituzione di una Important Bird Area, di tre Siti di Importanza Comunitaria e di una Zona di Protezione Speciale. L'analisi dei riferimenti bibliografici, dei dati d'erbario e le indagini floristiche effettuate dal 1999 al 2008, hanno consentito di censire 657 entitÃ  floristiche, appartenenti a 88 famiglie e 320 generi. Tra queste, 11 entitÃ  (Avena sativa subsp. macrantha, A. sterilis subsp. ludoviciana, Chenopodium hybridum, Cuscuta campestris, Mentha arvensis, Rosa andegavensis, R. dumalis, Schedonorus uechtritzianus, Scrophularia umbrosa, Trifolium alexandrinum e Veronica catenata) risultano nuove per la flora umbra e 2 (Crypsis alopecuroides e Schedonorus uechtritzianus) per quella marchigiana. Sono state individuate numerose specie rare e minacciate per la flora umbro-marchigiana, tra cui: Alopecurus bulbosus, Carex tomentosa, Equisetum fluviatile, Juncus hybridus, Nymphaea alba, Ophioglossum vulgatum, Ranunculus flammula, R. ophioglossifolius, Trifolium patens e Utricularia australis. Tuttavia alcune specie segnalate in passato per la Palude di Colfiorito e delle quali sono stati verificati i relativi exsiccata come Eriophorum latifolium, Hippuris vulgaris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Menyanthes trifoliata, Potamogeton lucens, P. trichoides, Ranunculus lingua e Triglochin palustre, non sono state ritrovate e ritenute localmente scomparse.},

 abstract = {A question of broad economic and social significance is the extent to which farming in prehistoric times, and perhaps even in historical times, was characterised by cultivation on a small scale and with intensive methods. Archaeobotanically, a distinction may be possible between intensive and extensive cultivation on the basis of the weed seeds associated with ancient grain samples. To this end, an ecological study was carried out in central Ewia of the weeds of winter-sown pulses grown both intensively in gardens and extensively in fields. The recorded weed flora was demonstrably influenced by relevant husbandry variables, such as method of tillage (with hoe or plough), weeding, manuring and soil organic content. The closest correspondence, however, was with the size, type and location of cultivated plots, suggesting that the weed flora was determined by a combination of these husbandry variables. In conclusion, the potential is briefly discussed of disentangling these variables for application in an archacobotanical context.},

 abstract = {A range of cool season grain legume species have shown considerable potential
for soils unsuitable for the production of narrow-leafed lupin
(Lupinus angustifolius L.) at limited sites in the
Mediterranean-type environments of south-western Australia. In this study the
adaptation of these grain legume species was compared by measuring crop
phenology, growth, and yield in field experiments at a total of 36 sites over
3 seasons, with the aim of identifying species with suitable adaptation and
seed yield for specific environments.
The grain legumes examined appeared to fall into 3 categories:
(i) field pea (Pisum sativum L.),
faba bean (Vicia faba L.), common vetch
(Vicia sativa L.), and narbon bean
(Vicia narbonensis L.) clearly had superior seed yield
to the other species over a wide number of sites and years across
south-western Australia (mean 1.0â€“2.3 t/ha);
(ii) albus lupin (Lupinus albus
L.), desi chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and
Lathyrus cicera, L. sativus, and
L. ochrus produced seed yields of 1â€“1.3 t/ha;
and (iii) red lentil
(Lens culinaris L.), bitter vetch
(Vicia ervilia), and kabuli chickpea
(Cicer arietinum L.) generally produced the lowest
yields (0.6â€“1.0 t/ha). There were clear species Ã— environment
interactions. At low-yielding sites (<1.4 t/ha), field pea was the
highest yielding species, while faba bean often produced the highest seed
yields under more favourable conditions at high yielding sites. Lentil, bitter
vetch, Lathyrus spp., and desi chickpea showed average
response to increasing mean site yield. Soil pH and clay content and rainfall
were the environmental factors identified as the most important in determining
seed yields. Soil pH and clay content appeared to be especially important in
the adaptation of lentil, narbon bean, bitter vetch, and kabuli chickpea, with
these species performing best in soils with pH >6.0 and clay contents
>15%. Seed yields were positively correlated with dry matter
production at maturity across a number of sites
(r2 = 0.40,
P < 0.01). Future improvements in seed yield of these
species are likely to come from management practices that increase dry matter
production such as increased plant density and early sowing, and through the
development of genotypes with greater tolerance to low winter temperatures,
and more rapid phenology, canopy development, and dry matter production than
existing commercial cultivars.},

 abstract = {Performances of 18 winter cereal, grain legume and oilseed crops were compared on the Darling Downs in 1976 using cultural practices appropriate for each. All crops, except for faba bean, which had a lower population than desired, established satisfactorily. The season was characterised by twice the average number (55) of heavy frosts, although only safflower appeared to be adversely affected. Heavy rain around maturity caused lodging of the prostrate crops lathyrus and field pea, some pod shattering of most grain legumes, and delays in machine-harvest, due to waterlogging, of almost all crops. Barley and canary seed were affected by powdery mildew during August and early September but recovered after rain in mid-September. Later rainfall promoted the diseases Alternaria carthami in safflower and Puccinia sp. in vetch, reducing grain yields in both crops. Except for chickpea, all grain legumes nodulated effectively. Lathyrus produced more larger (  >3 mm diameter) nodules than any other grain legume while lentil and vetch had many small (<2 mm) nodules. At floral initiation, more herbage DM was produced by triticale and oats than all other crops except barley and fieldpea. The most productive grain legumes were fieldpea, lathyrus and lentil. All oilseeds produced similar quantities of herbage DM, which were greater than those for grain legumes but less than those for cereals. Nitrogen concentration in herbage increased in the order: cereals < oilseeds <grain legumes. Machine-harvested grain yields of cereals were generally higher than those of oilseeds or grain legumes but delayed harvest caused large grain losses for many oilseeds and grain legumes. Pod shattering and crop lodging caused large yield losses in rapeseed and field peas, respectively. Lupins (cv. Ultra) produced more harvestable grain (1.6 t/ha) than any other grain legume, rapeseed, safflower or canary seed. An even higher grain yield (3.9 t/ha) was measured at a nearby site on an acid soil. Of the other grain legumes, lentil and lathyrus appear to be poorly adapted for this region while faba bean and vetch appear moderately well suited.},

Geraldton, Medicago polymorpha, Vicia faba, Erodium sp. and Arctotheca calendula growing in or adjacent to lupin crops. The experimental host range of the virus included T. subterraneum cv. Clare, T. repens, Pisurn sativum, Vicia faba and Cicer arietinum. A seed transmission rate of 12-15% was demonstrated in field-infected lupins, and it is concluded that the epidemic probably arose through primary introduction of virus into crops in seed, followed by secondary spread by aphids. The possible role of alternative host species as a reservoir is discussed.},

sites covering the range of environments experienced in the cropping region of

1 of 2 genotypes, and shown to increase under conditions of increasing soil
sulfur availability, pH, clay content, cation exchange capacity, concentration
of exchangeable cations, and salinity. To capitalise on the agricultural
potential of this species we recommend the selection of genotypes that break
the linkage between GEC and seed sulfur. In Lathyrus
species the degree of variation of Î²-N-oxalyl-L-Î±,
Î²-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP) in the seed appears to be proportional to
the species mean ODAP concentration; L. ochrus was more
responsive than L. sativus, which was in turn more
responsive than L. cicera. Seed ODAP concentrations in
L. ochrus and L. sativus were
positively correlated with soil phosphorus, and negatively correlated with
clay content and salinity, and may constrain the species potential for human

concentrations were extremely variable in the field (0.01â€“0.17%),

All solarization treatments suppressed winter and summer weeds with no significant difference among the plastic materials, although biodegradable film was less efficient in controlling common purslane and common amaranth. Weed infestation at the harvest of both lettuce cultivars was not affected by the solarizing material, whereas fewer weeds were found in the plots grown with â€˜Bacioâ€™ than with â€˜Moringaâ€™. Lettuce yield in two successive growing seasons was always significantly higher in solarized plots than in nontreated control, without any statistical difference among the plastic materials. Yield and head quality of cv. â€˜Bacioâ€™ were higher than â€˜Moringaâ€™ in the first growing season, but the opposite occurred in the second crop. Soil solarization was confirmed to be effective for weed management in field lettuce crops in the Mediterranean areas, although weed suppression may be affected also by the lettuce cultivar. Choice of solarizing materials, when similarly effective on weeds and crop yield, should take into account also their cost. Low density polyethylene plastics emerged as the best choice in conventional lettuce crops as highly effective as, and less expensive than the other materials, whereas the use of biodegradable films should be limited to organic lettuce systems.},

 abstract = {Seeds provide an efficient means in disseminating plant virus and viroid diseases. The success of modern agriculture depends on pathogen free seed with high yielding character and in turn disease management. There is a serious scientific concern about the transmission of plant viruses sexually through seed and asexually through plant propagules. The present book provides the latest information along with the total list of seed transmitted virus and viroid diseases at global level including, the yield losses, diagnostic techniques, mechanism of seed transmission, epidemiology and virus disease management aspects. Additional information is also provided on the transmission of plant virus and virus-like diseases through vegetative propagules. It is also well known that seed transmitted viruses are introduced into new countries and continents during large-scale traffic movements through infected germplasm and plant propogules. The latest diagnostic molecular techniques in different virus-host combinations along with disease management measures have been included. The book shall be a good reference source and also a text book to the research scientists, teachers, students of plant pathology, agriculture, horticulture, life sciences, green house managers, professional entrepreneurs, persons involved in quarantines and seed companies. This book has several important features of seed transmitted virus diseases and is a good informative source and thus deserves a place in almost all university libraries, seed companies and research organizations.},

 abstract = {Pulses have constituted an important food source for prehistoric communities in the Old World, yet little is known as regards their processing for consumption through the archaeobotanical record. This paper provides an overview of archaeobotanical evidence for the use of pulses in prehistoric Greece based on two case studies from the north, and explores (a) their preparation for consumption, in particular their detoxification and (b) the consumption of pulses as a component of ordinary daily meals in prehistoric times, as well as those for special occasions, within a context of feasting and ritual. The paper examines charred remains of Vicia ervilia (bitter vetch) and Lathyrus sativus (grass pea) from early Bronze Age Agios Athanasios and late Neolithic Kremasti Koiladas, respectively, as the former provides a basis for a pilot exploration of pulse detoxification and the latter, due to its origin, offers a rare opportunity to discuss the context of consumption. In the pilot exploration of pulse seed preparation for consumption, the inner cotyledon morphology of modern V. ervilia seeds which were experimentally processed with water and pounding was examined macroscopically and through SEM micrographs. Preliminary observations suggest that intentional splitting of pulse seeds as part of processing for consumption as food may be recognisable in the archaeobotanical record. Processing with water may also be detected. The particular context of the Kremasti finds suggests that pulses, in this particular case L. sativus, may have constituted special foods for particular occasions, loaded with symbolic meaning.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nuclear DNA amount in an unreplicated haploid chromosome complement (1C-value) is a key diversity character with many uses. Angiosperm C-values have been listed for reference purposes since 1976, and pooled in an electronic database since 1997 (http://www.kew.org/cval/homepage). Such lists are cited frequently and provide data for many comparative studies. The last compilation was published in 2000, so a further supplementary list is timely to monitor progress against targets set at the first plant genome size workshop in 1997 and to facilitate new goal setting.
SCOPE: The present work lists DNA C-values for 804 species including first values for 628 species from 88 original sources, not included in any previous compilation, plus additional values for 176 species included in a previous compilation.
CONCLUSIONS: 1998-2002 saw striking progress in our knowledge of angiosperm C-values. At least 1700 first values for species were measured (the most in any five-year period) and familial representation rose from 30 % to 50 %. The loss of many densitometers used to measure DNA C-values proved less serious than feared, owing to the development of relatively inexpensive flow cytometers and computer-based image analysis systems. New uses of the term genome (e.g. in 'complete' genome sequencing) can cause confusion. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative C-value for Arabidopsis thaliana (125 Mb) was a gross underestimate, and an exact C-value based on genome sequencing alone is unlikely to be obtained soon for any angiosperm. Lack of this expected benchmark poses a quandary as to what to use as the basal calibration standard for angiosperms. The next decade offers exciting prospects for angiosperm genome size research. The database (http://www.kew.org/cval/homepage) should become sufficiently representative of the global flora to answer most questions without needing new estimations. DNA amount variation will remain a key interest as an integrated strand of holistic genomics.},

 abstract = {Roadsides are frequently colonized by eurychorous species with a wide ecological and coenological amplitude. Stenoic and stenochorous plant species are often missing in synanthropic vegetation. An exception is Echium boissieriSteud., occurring in Central and Southern Spain, Portugal, Northern Morocco and Algeria. To determine whether this species is a â€œhomeless roadside plantâ€, we analysed herbarium specimens, performed a detailed mapping of current populations on both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar, sampled phytosociological relevÃ©s and gathered the available coenological data from literature.
Echium boissieri is a hapaxanthous perennial herb and belongs to section Eleuterolepis. The analysis of herbarium specimens indicates a recent apophytization that implies a trend from primary (rocks, screes, landslides) and secondary habitats (extensive pastures, fallow lands) to roadsides during the last two centuries, particularly in Spain. This habitat change coincides with land-use changes. The Chamaeleo gummiferi-Echietumboissieri is described as a new association. This is a multi-layered herbaceous vegetation type with an enormous species- and lifeform-diversity. It is characterized by E. boissieri and Chamaeleon gummifer, and by the transgression of grassland (Phalaridetalia) and weed species (Ridolfion). The association grows on steep slopes of road embankments and on grazed pastures. The role of roadside habitats for nature conservation in intensively used landscapes is discussed.

 abstract = {The genetic diversity of legumes in the Mediterranean basin far exceeds that of Australia. The one exception is subterranean clover, where Australian variation approaches that of the Mediterranean. Evidence from weed populations suggests that capacity to outcross is important for the widespread establishment of volunteer species, including pasture legumes. Subterranean clover outcrosses occasionally, and this may be important in producing the genetic variation necessary to cope with environmental variation. Based on pollen/ovule ratios most other naturalised legumes appear to outcross less frequently than subterranean clover.Mediterranean species employ many reproductive strategies. In high rainfall areas these appear to be substitutable, early flowering, for example, being replaced by high seed dormancy in some species. Reproductive strategies narrow substantially in arid areas, and include high seed dormancy, high seed to pod ratio, restricted dispersal capabilities, low flower abortion and early flowering. Most of these arid-type strategies are also found in widespread species.The control of germination, both within and between seasons, is a strategy of special significance. The within season pattern of hard seed breakdown is seen to be important in a number of species, including some that are widely naturalised in Australia. This strategy controls germination in summer and early autumn, restricting it to a period when following rains are likely. A slow rate of germination and dormancy at high temperatures may serve similar purposes. Dispersal mechanisms that assist seeds escape or tolerate grazing are also highly desirable traits to which we pay insufficient attention. These include the capacity of small seeds (< 1 mg) to survive ingestion by sheep, and the burial of larger seeds (5â€“60 mg) at depths where they become unavailable.It is concluded that we must continue to explore the genetic resources of the Mediterranean basin, especially of species other than subterranean clover and the annual medics. The diversity of species and genotypes available, and the reproductive strategies and genetic variability that they possess, bode well for increasing the range of pasture legumes available to Australian farmers.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews current knowledge concerning the occurrence, losses caused, epidemiology, and management of virus diseases of annual pasture legumes. The viruses commonly present are spread by contact, or aphid vectors either non-persistently or persistently. Whether they are seed-borne and their means of transmission are critical factors determining their incidences within pastures in climatic zones with dry summers or substantial summer rainfall. Large-scale national or state surveys of subterranean clover pastures revealed that some viruses reach high infection incidences. Contamination with seed-borne viruses was widespread in plots belonging to annual pasture legume improvement programs and seed stocks of subterranean clover, annual medics, and alternative annual pasture legumes, and in commercial annual medic seed stocks. Yield loss studies with grazed swards were completed for three common viruses: two in subterranean clover and one in annual medics. These studies demonstrated considerable virus-induced losses in herbage and seed yields, and established that virus infection causes deteriorated pastures with high weed contents even when foliar symptoms are mild. Comprehensive integrated disease management tactics involving phytosanitary, cultural, chemical, or host resistance measures were devised for these three viruses in infected pastures, and for seed-borne viruses in annual pasture legume improvement programs. Several other viruses are potentially important, but, with these, quantification of losses caused in grazed swards is lacking and information on incidences in pastures is currently insufficient. Critical research and development gaps that need addressing are identified.},

We studied the response to O. crenata of a germplasm collection of grass pea in field trials over two seasons showing that the level of infection was highly influenced by environmental factors and plant growth cycle. Earlier or very late accessions were less infected. O. crenata infection increased with host plant vigour. O. crenata infection strongly reduced host biomass and grain yield.

An Inter-Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) technique was employed to assess genetic diversity and relationships of seven Mediterranean species of the genus Lathyrus belonging to four sections (Lathyrus, Clymenum, Nissolia and Aphaca). The molecular characterization and fingerprint identification of 11 populations representing the Lathyrus species were conducted using 11 ISSR primers (seven 3â€™ anchored primers and four non-anchored primers). A total of 261 polymorphic markers have been successfully generated, ranging between 400 and 3000Â base pairs, with a mean of 23.72Â bands/primer. The percentage of polymorphic bands for these species was 98.12%. The ISSR technique was able to characterize and differentiate between the different studied genotypes of the Lathyrus species. Genetic distance within and between populations was estimated by calculating the similarity index. The similarity indices ranged from 0.251â€“0.741, with a mean of 0.386. Our data provide evidence of high molecular polymorphism, showing that both wild and cultivated species forms constitute an important pool of diversity. Despite the large distant geographical origin site, the accessions per species issued from different geographical origins are relatively related. Moreover, the genetic similarity tree showed that the two species L.Â sativus and L.Â cicera are similar showing that L.Â sativus may be derived from L.Â cicera, whereas the principal component analysis showed a clear divergence of the L.Â ochrus population belonging to section Clymenum from the other populations. Furthermore, L.Â ochrus appears to be closer to L.Â aphaca and L.Â nissolia than to the other studied species belonging to section Lathyrus.},

L'area, con un'estensione di circa 1050 ettari, Ã¨ inclusa tra le isole fossili carbonatiche della Toscana meridionale con le quali viene effettuato un confronto fitogeografico. Dopo una breve descrizione dei lineamenti geomorfologici, climatici e vegetazionali del territorio viene riportato l'elenco della flora vascolare rilevata in seguito ad erborizzazioni, fonti bibliografiche e campioni d'erbario. La flora risulta costituita da 640 specie autoctone, suddivise in 87 famiglie e 323 generi, a cui vanno aggiunte 13 entitÃ  esotiche. Lo spettro biologico evidenzia la dominanza delle emicriptofite (43.4%), seguite dalle terofite (26.6%) e dalle geofite (15.8%); l'analisi corologica indica una codominanza di elementi eurasiatici e mediterranei con un notevole apporto di specie boreali e appenniniche. oltre agli endemiti stenocori (Cerastium arvense ssp. arvense var. etruscum e Ornithogalum etruscum), nella Riserva si trovano numerose entitÃ  interessanti sia dal punto di vista fitogeografico che conservazionistico tra cui Delphinium fissum, Silene muscipula, Prunus mahaleb, Anchusella cretica, Centaurea scabiosa e Sternbergia colchiciflora confermando l'importanza dell'area a livello regionale per la conservaizone della diversitÃ  vegetale.},

 abstract = {Aposematic (warning) coloration is a common defense in plants, although it was largely ignored before 2001. The fact that many aposematic animals use both plant-based pigments and sequestered poisonous molecules to become aposematic emphasizes the absurdity of neglecting the aposematic nature of so many plants. Similar to the situation in animals, aposematic coloration in plants is commonly yellow, orange, red, brown, black, white, or combinations of these colors. Aposematic coloration is expressed by thorny, spiny, prickly and poisonous plants, and by plants that are unpalatable for various other reasons. Plants that mimic aposematic plants or aposematic animals are also known. Many types of aposematic coloration also serve other functions at the same time, such as physiological, communicative and even other defensive functions. It is therefore difficult in many cases to evaluate the relative functional share of visual aposematism in various color patterns of plants and the specific selective agents involved in their evolution. Aposematic coloration is part of a broader phenomenon of defensive coloration in plants; this topic has also received only limited attention, as is evident from the lack of a regular and systematic description of these color patterns in published floras.},

 abstract = {Lathyrus (Leguminosae; Papilionoideae) is the largest genus in tribe Fabeae and exhibits an intriguing extratropical distribution. We studied the systematics and biogeography of Lathyrus using sequence data, from accessions representing 53 species, for the internal transcribed spacer plus 5.8S-coding region of nuclear ribosomal DNA as well as the trnL-F and trnS-G regions of chloroplast DNA. Our results generally supported recent morphology-based classifications, resolving clades corresponding to sections Lathyrus and Lathyrostylis, but question the monophyly of the large, widespread section Orobus sensu Asmussen and Liston. Sections Orobus, Aphaca, and Pratensis form a predominantly northern Eurasian-New World clade. Within this clade, the North American and eastern Eurasian species, including both Holarctic species (L. palustris and L. japonicus), form a transberingian clade of relatively recent origin and diversification. The South American Notolathyrus group is distant from this transberingian lineage and should be reinstated as a distinct section within the northern Eurasian-New World clade. The Notolathyrus lineage reached the New World most probably through long-distance dispersal from Eurasia. The remaining sections in the genus are centered on the Mediterranean region.},

Experimental assessments of grain legume performances are required, to identify potential species with high yields. Here, we introduce a dataset including results of field experiments published in 173 articles. The selected experiments were carried out over five continents on 39 grain legume species. The dataset includes measurements of grain yield, aerial biomass, crop nitrogen content, residual soil nitrogen content and water use. When available, yields for cereals and oilseeds grown after grain legumes in the crop sequence are also included. The dataset is arranged into a relational database with nine structured tables and 198 standardized attributes. Tillage, fertilization, pest and irrigation management are systematically recorded for each of the 8,581 crop*field site*growing season*treatment combinations. The dataset is freely reusable and easy to update. We anticipate that it will provide valuable information for assessing grain legume production worldwide.},

 abstract = {Genetic erosion, that is, the loss of native plant and genetic diversity has been exponential from the Mediterranean Basin through the Twentieth century. This careless eradication of species and genetic diversity as a result of human activities from a 'hot-spot' of diversity threatens sustainable agriculture and food security for the temperate regions of the world. Since the early 1900s there has been a largely ad hoc movement to halt the loss of plant diversity and enhance its utilisation. The Convention on Biological Diversity and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources, both highlight the need to improve conservation methodologies and enhance utilisation techniques. It has been argued that the most important component of biodiversity is the genetic diversity of crop and forage species used to feed humans and livestock. These cultivated and related wild species provides the raw material for further selection and improvement. Leguminosae species are of major economic importance (peas, chickpeas, lentils and faba beans, as well as numerous forage species) and provide a particularly rich source of protein for human and animal foods. Their distribution is concentrated in the Mediterranean region and therefore the improvement of their conservation and use in the region is critical. This text is designed to help ensure an adequate breadth of legume diversity is conserved and to help maximise the use of that conserved diversity. The subjects of conservation and use of legume diversity, the Mediterranean ecosystem and taxonomy of legumes are introduced. Generic reviews of the taxonomy, centre of diversity, ecogeographic distribution, genetic diversity distribution, conservation status, conservation gaps and future research needs are provided, along with a discussion of the importance of rhizobia to the maintenance of legume diversity. Current ex situ and in situ conservation activities as well current legume uses are reviewed. In conclusion future priorities for ex situ and in situ plant genetic conservation and use of Mediterranean legumes are highlighted. All contributors look forward rather than simply reviewing past and current activities and therefore it is hoped that the identification of genetic erosion, location of taxonomic and genetic diversity and promotion of more efficient utilisation of conserved material will be enhanced.},

 abstract = {Seven field experiments were done in 19944â€”98 to determine the
relative susceptibilities and sensitivities of a wide range of alternative
crop, annual pasture, and forage legumes to infection with cucumber mosaic
virus (CMV). Seed harvested from some species was tested for seed transmission
of the virus. Most of the 24 genotypes of
Cicer arietinum and 39 of
Lens culinaris tested in 2 replicated field experiments
were ranked as highly susceptible or susceptible; moderate resistance was
recorded in 8Lens culinaris genotypes, the most
resistant of which was ILL7163, and in C. arietinum cv.
Amethyst Mutant. Sensitivity varied from low to high in different
Lens culinaris genotypes, whereas in
C. arietinum they were all sensitive or highly
sensitive. In 4 other experiments, 12 species (49 genotypes) of other crop
legumes were ranked as follows: Vicia narbonensis
susceptible to moderately resistant, V. ervilia
susceptible, Pisum sativum resistant, and
V. faba resistant to potentially highly resistant;
Lathyrus cicera,L. clymenum,
L. ochrus, L. sativus,
L. tingitanus, V. benghalensis,
V. monantha, and V. s a t i v a
were not infected. V. ervilia
andV. faba were very sensitive to infection, but
V. narbonensis had intermediate sensitivity and
P. s a t i v u m was tolerant. When single genotypes of
each of 16 pasture and forage species were tested in 2 replicated field
experiments, 1 was highly susceptible, 3 were susceptible, 9 moderately
resistant, 2 resistant, and 1 was potentially highly resistant. The 4 most
susceptible were the sensitive species
Trifolium incarnatum and
T. isthmocarpum and the intermediately sensitive species
T. michelianum and T. vesiculosum.
T. squarrosum (intermediate sensitivity) and
T. spumosum (very sensitive) were resistant and
Ornithopus sativus was not infected. In sap
inoculations,
L. ochrus,L. sativus, and
P. sativum occasionally became infected. In aphid
inoculations,Lens culinaris ILL7163 and
V. faba became infected only rarely and
V. benghalensis cv. Popany developed a systemic
hypersensitive reaction. The following were not infected in the field or
glasshouse: L. cicera ATC80521,
L. clymenum C7022, O. sativus cv.
Cadiz, and V. sativa cv. Languedoc.Seed transmission of
CMV was detected for the first time in one crop species,
V. narbonensis(0.1mp;mdash;0.8%), and confirmed
in C. arietinum (0.2â€“0.3%) and
Lens culinaris (0.3%). It was also detected in
T. cherleri (0.05%),
T. clypeatum (0.05%),
T. dasyurum (0.1%),
T. incarnatum (5%),
T. purpureum (0.04%),
T. spumosum (0.5%),
T. squarrosum (0.1%), and
T. vesiculosum (1%), but not in 8 other pasture
or forage species.
The high susceptibility and sensitivity to CMV of some alternative crop,
annual pasture, and forage legumes is cause for concern, especially when they
are intended for sowing in CMV-prone high rainfall zones. Infection of seed
stocks with CMV is also of concern as it leads to inadvertent introductions of
the virus.},

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3372/wi.45.45211 The alien flora of the Greek island of Rodos (SE Aegean) is presented. This study is based on fieldwork carried out by the author up to June 2015, as well as on the literature found to date. The present checklist consists of 101 alien taxa of vascular plants, of which 27 are recorded for the first time as new for the alien flora of Rodos. Of these, 14 are also new for the alien flora of Greece. Of these, seven are naturalized: Austrocylindropuntia subulata, Erythrina lysistemon, Ficus microcarpa, Myoporum tenuifolium, Senecio angulatus, Washingtonia filifera and Yucca gloriosa; and seven are casual: Bauhinia variegata, Brachychiton populneus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Pittosporum tobira, Thevetia peruviana and Phymosia umbellata. The last taxon is also recorded as a new for the alien flora of Europe. In addition, 13 alien taxa of marine algae are recorded. Each taxon is listed with its status (naturalized or casual, neophyte or archaeophyte), as well as its geographical origin. For each of the 27 taxa recorded as new for Rodos, localities and dates of field observations are provided, as well as a voucher specimen and at least one voucher photograph for each taxon. The modes of introduction of alien taxa to Rodos and their modes of dispersal within the island, as well as the invasion success and effects of invasive alien taxa, are discussed. The numbers of alien taxa in Rodos and other areas in the Mediterranean region are compared.},

Es war also zunÃ¤chst angebracht, das taxonomische Material zu aktualisieren und die Synonyme bis auf wenige, in der Forschung noch diskutierte (z. B. Pritzelago = Hutchinsia) oder aus Gewohnheit beibehaltene Relikte (z. B. Ophrys fuciflora statt regelhaftem Ophrys holoserica) zu eliminieren. Zugleich habe ich die MateÂ­ rialgrundlage durch die massenhafte Neuaufnahme von Gattungen und Arten der Bakterien, Algen, Flechten, Moose und Farne, aber auch der Gymnospermen und Angiospermen, erheblich erweitert. Aus konventionellen GrÃ¼nden sind auch die mykologischen Taxa weiterhin in diesem Buch vertreten, selbst wenn nach neueren Erkenntnissen die Pilze nicht mehr dem Pflanzenreich zugeordnet werden kÃ¶nnen.

Two locations in each of four years were treated as separate environments, to give eight environments altogether. Genotype x environment (GÃ—E) interactions were analysed using linear regression.There was considerable variation in herbage and seed yields within both lines and environments. Genotype x environment interactions were present for both herbage and seed yields; a little over half was accounted for by the linear regression. The non-linear component was also significant, although it was smaller than that of the linear component.The most stable herbage and seed yields were obtained from L. sativus. Two selections, 347 and 311, origmating from Syria and Turkey respectively, combined both high herbage and seed yields with wide adaptation and stability, and could be considered the most widely adapted lines. Other lines were identified as suitable for favourable and unfavourable environments; in particular, all four lines of L. ochrus have great potential in frost-free climates. The importance of genotype x environment interactions in future breeding strategies is discussed.},

 abstract = {The diversity of local Mediterranean food elements is not known in detail, but offers itself to search for new vegetables, salads, fruits and spices which could be used in to enrich diets outside their region of origin. Most amid those interesting local elements are edible wild plants and weeds. Ethnobotanical research has identified ca. 2,300 different plant and fungi taxa, which are gathered and consumed in the Mediterranean. Among these, >1,000 are only consumed in one single zone, therefore are strictly local. The percentage of local gathered food plant (GFP) taxa (present in <5 samples), is higher in the main centers of diversity at the periphery of the Mediterranean (Sahara, Alps, Caucasus, Canary Islands, the Levant). Islands (Sicily, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus) also show a high proportion. Endemism of GFP taxa only accounts for a limited number of these 'ethnobotanical endemics' (only ca. 350 are endemic/ endangered species). On the other hand, only a few taxa--30 occurring in >20 samples--are consumed in most of the Mediterranean. Most have been analyzed in the Local Food- Nutraceuticals project. The ca. 800 GFP taxa that occur in more than the 5% of localities show a geographical pattern that permits one to recognize seven geographical groups. These groups show relationships with types of Mediterranean diet and could also be related with human genetic polymorphism through long-term co-evolution in a geographical mosaic pattern.},

In the intervening years well over 10,000 articles have appeared with lectins as the main subject, and more than twice as many in which they were touched upon, as well as around 20 books. In particular, great strides have been made in several areas of lectin research, about which little was known until the late 1980s. One prominent example is animal lectins, many of which have been discovered only during the last decade and the functions of several of which have been clarified, especially as to their key role in innate immunity. Another is the structure of lectins and of their combining sites. Thus, whereas at that time the three-dimensional structures of just three lectins and a few of their complexes with sugars had been elucidated, their numbers have increased to about 160 and over 200, respectively, and continue to grow unabated. Updating the information on these and other topics resulted in a marked expansion of the book, which is now nearly four times as long as the first edition, with 226 figures and 39 tables. Still, a few topics, such as carbohydrate-binding cytokines or bacterial toxins that are sometimes considered as lectins, have been dealt with only in passing. Similarly to the first edition, Lectins II starts with an overview of the history of lectin research.},

 abstract = {Economically, legumes (Fabaceae) represent the second most important family of crop plants after the grass family, Poaceae. Grain legumes account for 27% of world crop production and provide 33% of the dietary protein consumed by humans, while pasture and forage legumes provide vital part of animal feed. Fabaceae, the third largest family of flowering plants, has traditionally been divided into the following three subfamilies: Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Papilionoideae, all together with 800 genera and 20,000 species. The latter subfamily contains most of the major cultivated food and feed crops. Among the grain legumes are some of mankind's earliest crop plants, whose domestication parallelled that of cereals: Soybean in China; faba bean, lentil, chickpea and pea in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East; cowpeas and bambara groundnut in Africa; soybean and mungbeans in East Asia; pigeonpea and the grams in South Asia; and common bean, lima bean, scarlet runner bean, tepary bean and lupin in Central and South America. The importance of legumes is evidenced by their high representation in ex situ germplasm collections, with more than 1,000,000 accessions worldwide. A detailed knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships of the Fabaceae is essential for understanding the origin and diversification of this economically and ecologically important family of angiosperms. This review aims to combine the phylogenetic and genetic diversity approaches to better illustrate the origin, domestication history and preserved germplasm of major legume crops from 13 genera of six tribes and to indicate further potential both for science and agriculture.},

Four quantitative traits were analyzed: length of the pod, width of the pod, weight of seeds from the pod and 100 seed weight. The results of the study demonstrated that, the Bennettâ€™s method is less restrictive (lesser species were found to be uniform in analyzed traits) compared to the Millerâ€™s one.},

 abstract = {It is a distressing truism that the human race during the last millennium has caused the exponential loss of plant genetic diversity throughout the world. This has had direct and negative economic, political and social consequences for the human race, which at the same time has failed to exploit fully the positive benefits that might result from conserving and exploiting the world's plant genetic resources. However, a strong movement to halt this loss of plant diversity and enhance its utilisation for the benefit of all humanity has been underway since the 1960's (Frankel and Bennett, 1970; Frankel and Hawkes, 1975). This initiative was taken up by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 1992) that not only expounds the need to conserve biological diversity but links conservation to exploitation and development for the benefit of all. Article 8 of the Convention clearly states the need to develop more effective and efficient guidelines to conserve biological diversity, while Article 9, along with the FAO International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources, promotes the adoption of a complementary approach to conservation that incorporates both ex situ and in situ techniques.},

 abstract = {Identifying the respective role of environmental, landscape and management factors in explaining the patterns in community composition is an important goal in ecology. Using a set of 32 temporary ponds in northern Morocco we studied the respective importance of local (within the pond) and regional (density of ponds in landscape) factors and the impacts of different land uses on the plant species assemblages, separating pond and terrestrial species. The main hypotheses tested were that (1) species assemblages respond to both local and regional environmental factors, (2) anthropogenic pressure has a negative influence on the number of pond species, and that (3) human activities differ in their impact on pond biodiversity. The results showed that (1) local factors explain most of the variation in plant community composition, and (2) land use impacts the communities through changing local environmental conditions, leading to a loss of typical pond species. Aside from recreation, all other activities (grazing, drainage, agriculture and partial urbanisation) significantly reduced the number of pond species. The conservation strategy for rare pond species should focus on maintaining networks of oligotrophic ponds, while allowing only low-impact activities.},

 abstract = {The increasing global rate of road construction is leading to a parallel increase of areas of degraded soil conditions and steep slopes that need revegetation. Hydroseeding with commercial seeds of fastâ€growing grasses and legumes is a common practice in revegetation of motorway slopes. We carried out 3 years of monitoring of vegetation dynamics on hydroseeded and nonhydroseeded motorway slopes (48 slopes) in a maritime Mediterranean zone in MÃ¡laga (southern Spain). Our main objectives were to test whether hydroseeding significantly increases species richness and plant cover and whether hydroseeded species act as starters, facilitating the establishment of the vegetation and quickly disappearing once the communities are established. A hydroseeding success index (HSI, ranging from 0 to 1) was used to assess the relative abundance over time of the 14 species from the hydroseeding mixture. Species richness and cover was significantly higher on embankments (50â€“70 species per embankment, 80â€“90% cover) than on roadcuts (6â€“10 species per roadcut, 18â€“30% cover). Performance of hydroseeded species was poor from the very beginning (HSI, 0.2â€“0.3). On embankments, either presence or abundance of hydroseeded species did not significantly vary throughout the study. Both hydroseeded and nonhydroseeded communities exhibited a significant decrease in species richness, a significant increase in plant cover, and a highly dynamic species composition over time, with Sorensen index of 0.3â€“0.5 between years. There were no significant differences in plant cover, species richness, and aboveground biomass between hydroseeded and nonhydroseeded plots on embankments throughout the study. Our results demonstrate that there are situations in which the use of hydroseeding for revegetation is not needed. Further research should focus on understanding the establishment of autochthonous species and identifying environmental conditions under which the addition of commercial seeds may not be needed, or indeed situations where it may be harmful in suppressing autochthonous species.},

The physiological races of isolates were identified using the two differential tomato cultivars â€˜Belladonnaâ€™ (susceptible to both races 1 and 2 of V. dahliae) and â€˜Ace 55VFâ€™ (resistant to race 1, susceptible to race 2 of V. dahliae). Among these isolates, 14 were race 2 (43.8%), 12 race 1 (37.5%) and six nonpathogenic (18.7%) on tomato. The host range pathogenicity of isolates was determined using four differential hosts (eggplant, turnip, tomato (Veâˆ’) and sweet pepper). Among isolates, five were pathogenic to both eggplant and turnip (15.6%), 21 to eggplant, turnip and tomato (65.6%), five to eggplant, turnip, tomato and sweet pepper (15.6%) and one was pathogenic to eggplant, turnip and sweet pepper (3.2%). The pathogenicity of isolates on the aforementioned five hosts was investigated on the basis of external symptoms and by calculating the relative areas under disease progress curves (relative AUDPC). Results showed that eggplant was the most susceptible, followed by turnip and tomato cv. Belladonna, while sweet pepper and tomato cv. Ace 55VF were less susceptible to all the isolates used. The pathogenicity of isolates varied from highly to mildly virulent on eggplant and turnip while on Belladonna, Ace 55VF and sweet pepper it varied from highly virulent to nonpathogenic. Belladonna exhibited a similar level of susceptibility to races 1 and 2 of V. dahliae, but was more susceptible than Ace 55VF to race 2. Interestingly, the isolates originating from eggplant were clearly more virulent than those originating from tomato and black nightshade on all solanaceous plants tested.},

 abstract = {Enhancement of cold tolerance is an important aspect in breeding forage legumes in view of increasing interest in extending the cultivation of these crops. Three classes of characters â€” morphological, morpho-physiological and biochemical â€” were considered in selection for cold-tolerance between and within forage legume species under contrasting growing conditions in the field and a plastic house. Significant correlation was found between cold damage and concentration of sugars m roots of various forage legume species which were grown under field conditions and subjected to natural frost. Both morphological as well as morpho-physiological characters were related to cold tolerance in Lathyrus ochrus (L.) DC. This indicated that chemical constituents cannot be used as a sole criterion to select for winter-hardy strains of this species. Root-shoot ratio showed a consistent relationship with tolerance to cold irrespective of the growing conditions and season. Hence, sugar concentration and root-shoot ratio are useful characters in testing species found cold tolerant by other methods. The root-shoot ratio could be used for testing cold tolerance under controlled conditions. The number of primary branches per plant, root weight and shoot weight may be used as morphological characters in selection for cold tolerance in L. ochrus under field conditions.},

Accessions were evaluated for cold tolerance using a 1 (Highly cold tolerant)-5 (Highly cold susceptible) visual scale. Considerable variation was found for cold tolerance and some agronomical characteristics in faba beans. Wild relatives of faba bean were found to be more tolerant to cold than those of cultivated faba beans. Although some pigmented accessions were free from freezing damage at âˆ’9.6Â°C without snow cover, accessions with white flowers were damaged. The proposed screening technique could easily be used to evaluate many faba bean accessions for cold tolerance.

 abstract = {Water supply is a major constraint to crop production particularly for grain legumes more than 80% of which are grown under rainfed conditions. Global warming is increasing the problem by creating serious water shortages and large inter-seasonal fluctuations. Water use efficiency (WUE) provides a quick and simple measure of how well rain or irrigation water can be converted into grain. It represents a given level of biomass or grain yield per unit of water used by the crop. Improving crop productivity therefore requires answering the following question. How can WUE be improved and how can cropping systems be modified to result in a more efficient use of water?A review of the literature reveals a large variation in WUE across a range of climate, soils and crops. Typically low and unstable yields of grain legumes are due to receding soil moisture at the time of sowing and terminal drought. Numerous studies have shown that grain yield is positively correlated with post-flowering water use. The actual crop water requirement usually varies with genotype, its growing duration and agronomic and soil management methods used. Differences in water requirements are mainly due to differences in canopy structure, root system and growth periods. Water stress adversely affects biological nitrogen fixation, plant growth, grain yield and WUE. Crop adaptation to drought is a function of the interaction of phenology with the pattern of water use. Plant architecture and root systems play a key role in the use of available soil moisture. Development of early flowering and pod set, rapid seed fill and early maturity varieties seems to be quite advantageous for increasing drought tolerance and improving WUE. It is possible to increase WUE, by 25â€“40% through soil management that involves deep tillage, crop residues, mulches, etc. Among agronomic practice options for increasing WUE, various experiments reveal about 12% increase in WUE associated with timely sowing. Supplemental irrigation at the reproductive phase may result in approximately 75% increase in grain yield and 35% increase in WUE. The drilling of phosphorus and zinc in deficient soils gives substantially higher grain yields and enhances water use. Conservation practices associated with harvesting the maximum amount of rain water and a watershed based water-harvesting and recycling system may be established on a large scale for providing life-saving irrigation. Sprinkling irrigation, drip irrigation or film hole irrigation practices save more than 50% water and increase the grain yield significantly. However, these advanced and costly techniques have very limited scope in grain legumes due to their low yields. Improved technology such as land leveling, crop rotation, intercropping, integrated use of farm resources and timely socio-economic interventions can help greatly in improving crop productivity and water use of cool season grain legumes.},

 abstract = {Vetchlings (Lathyrus spp.) are widely distributed in both Serbia and Srpska, and represent a valuable component of local floras all over the Balkan Peninsula. Despite this and the existence of a traditional Serbian name for grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), sastrica, and a pan-Slavic name for all vetchlings, grahor, today they are almost forgotten crops. The joint action of the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops and the Faculty of Agriculture is aimed at re-introducing grass pea and other vetchlings as multifunctional crops. Within the legume collection in the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, a small Lathyrus spp. collection, including about 100 accessions of 16 species, most of them being grass pea, was established in 2002. The landraces of grass pea were collected in several regions of Serbia and Srpska, where they are used for human consumption. Grass pea is commonly used boiled and along with other pulses, with no reports on lathyrism among the local people. The first Serbian breeding programme in Novi Sad produced already two grass pea lines that were registered in November 2009 under the names of Studenica and Sitnica, developed from the crosses of Polish cultivars and local Serbian landraces.},

                    Cicer arietinum

                    Vicia faba
                    L.) and woolly-pod vetch (

                    Orobanche
                    seed bank dynamics in three-course crop rotations would result in a high
                    Orobanche
                    seed population and hence in low yields of the respective crops. Replacing the susceptible by resistant legumes such as woolly-pod vetch in some of the cycles of the rotations would keep the
                    Orobanche
                    infestation at a low level without reducing the proportion of legumes. A three-course crop rotation with faba bean would have to be changed to a 12-coursc rotation in which faba bean was grown every twelfth year but was replaced by woolly-pod vetch or other resistant legumes in seasons 3, 6, 9; 15, 18, 21; and so on. In the three-course rotations with chickpea or lentil, these susceptible legumes would be grown every ninth year but would have to be replaced in seasons 3 and 6; 12 and 15; 21 and 24; and so on, thus changing these three-course rotations into nine-course rotations.

ISSN 0511-9618; 2003 BGBM Berlin-Dahlem. Lemnos island and its 10 offshore islets belong to the Prefecture of Lesvos and biogeographically to the N Aegean area. In comparison with other islands of the N Aegean area, Lemnos is characterized by an intense horizontal relief, absence of limestone cliffs, low land formations (highest point 429 m), medium inclination and intense human interference (agriculture, stock farming) almost on the entire island. Including the data from the available literature and the authors investigations, the flora of the area consists of about 681 plant taxa. The dominance of the Mediterranean elements and therophytes reflect the Mediterranean character of the Lemnos flora. Although its flora is rather poor, Lemnos conserves a high level ecological value based on the existence of a variety of different vegetation formations and habitat types such as wetlands, sand dunes, remnants of Quercus ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis forest and extended phryganic formations all over the island. The natural ecosystems (wetlands, sand dunes, etc.) have been degraded because of the intense human activities (extended agriculture, over-grazing, tourist facilities, etc.) and for this reason the adaptation of management measures is necessary for the conservation of the ecological value of the area.},

Some of these species disperse their seeds by wind (Nerium oleander, Anabasis articulata), others by adhering to animals with their spines (Emex spinosa) or prickles (Hedysarum spinosissimum). Certainly neither type uses red coloration as advertisement to attract the seed dispersing agents. Fleshy-fruited species (Rhamnus alaternus, Rubus sanguineus and Pistacia sp.), which disperse their seeds via frugivores, change fruit color from green to red while still unripe and then to black or dark blue upon ripening. The red color does not seem to function primarily in dispersal (unless red fruits form advertisement flags when there are already black ripe fruits on the plant) because the red unripe fruits of these species are poisonous, spiny, or unpalatable. The unripe red fruits of Nerium oleander are very poisonous, those of Rhamnus alaternus and Anabasis articulata are moderately poisonous, those of Rubus sanguineus are very sour, those of Pistacia sp. contain unpalatable resin and those of Emex spinosa and Hedysarum spinosissimum are prickly. We propose that these unripe red fruits are aposematic, protecting them from herbivory before seed maturation.},

For decades, archaeologists have classified spatial clusters of artefacts into discrete â€œculturesâ€, which have been conventionally treated as bound entities and equated with past social or ethnic groups. This timely volume fulfils the need for an up-to-date and theoretically informed dialogue on group identity in Balkan prehistory. Thirteen case studies covering the beginning of the Neolithic to the Middle Bronze Age and written by archaeologists conducting fieldwork in the region, as well as by ethnologists with a research focus on material culture and identity, provide a robust foundation for exploring these issues. Bringing together the latest research, with a particular intentional focus on the central and western Balkans, this collection offers original perspectives on Balkan prehistory with relevance to the neighbouring regions of Eastern and Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Anatolia.

As legumes are indigenous to the region, they are alternated with cereals and provide an essential source of biological nitrogen (N) for the cereals. Food legumes such as Kabuliâ€type chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) are basic foods for humans, while annual and perennial forage legumes provide valuable animal feed as grazing and hay. Since its inception, research at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) has focused on development of forage legumes in association with the national agricultural systems of the West Asiaâ€North Mrica region. While much effort has been expended on perennial selfâ€regenerating medic (Medicago spp.), adoption was limited because of technical difficulties. The greatest potential was with annual vetch (Vicia spp.) as a viable animal feed source and a rotation crop with cereals. Emphasis was also placed on forage legumes that survive harsh conditions by their unique underground growth habit, for example, V. amphicarpa and Lathyrus ciliolatus. Efforts to improve forage legumes were based on both management/cultural factors and breeding. Development of forage legumes is essential to agricultural sustainability in the Mediterranean region and in other areas of the world where grazing livestock area a dominant feature.},

 abstract = {Plant biotechnology is a most interesting branch for academicians and researchers in recent past. Now days, it becomes a very useful tool in agriculture and medicine and is regarded as a popular area of research especially in biological sciences because it makes an integral use of biochemistry, molecular biology and engineering sciences in order to achieve technological application of cultured tissues, cell and microbes. Plant tissue culture (PTC) refers to a technique of cultivation of plant cells and other parts on artificial nutrient medium in controlled environment under aseptic conditions. PTC requires various nutrients, pH, carbon source, gelling agent, temperature, photoperiod, humidity etc. and most importantly the judicious use of plant growth regulators. Various natural, adenine and phenyl urea derivatives are employed for the induction and proliferation of different types of explants. Several phenyl urea derivatives were evaluated and it was observed that thidiazuron (n-phenyl-Nâ€-1,2,3- thidiazol-5-ulurea) was found to be the most active among the plant growth regulators. Thidiazuron (TDZ) was initially developed as a cotton defoliant and showed high cytokinin like activity. In some examples, its activity was 100 times more than BA in tobacco callus assay and produces more number of shoots in cultures than Zeatin and 2iP. TDZ also showed major breakthrough in tissue culture of various recalcitrant legumes and woody species. For the last two decades, number of laboratories has been working on TDZ with different aspect and number of publications has come out. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive edited volume on this particular topic. Hence th,e edited volume is a deed to consolidate the scattered information on role of TDZ in plant tissue culture and genetic manipulations that would hopefully prove informative to various researches. Thidiazuron: From Urea Derivative to Plant Growth RegulatorÂ compiles various aspects of TDZ in Plant Tissue Culture with profitable implications. The book will provides basic material for academicians and researchers who want to initiate work in this fascinating area of research. The book will contain 26 chapters compiled by International dignitaries and thus giving a holistic view to the edited volume.},

 abstract = {In this work, we present a summary of an ethnobotanical research carried out in the whole Administrative Region of Apulia (southern Italy). The main topic of the investigation is the traditional knowledge about wild plants, focusing on their common names, on which parts were used in cooking and how they were used. The main aim was to establish a botanical knowledge about these culinary uses through a systematic identification of the species involved, directly in the field. In addition to this, we focused on the ecological aspects of these species and on their biological and chorological forms. Results suggest the existence of very strong ties between the local communities and this particular flora, without substantial differences between rural and urban areas or among different zones of the Apulia Region. On the other hand, in each area we found peculiar food uses, species, parts used, and recipes. The analysed wild plants still have a fundamental role in the local diet, which can predominantly be ascribed to the Mediterranean model. Moreover, we documented an increasing interest in the culinary uses of these species: in the Gargano area, for instance, more and more cultivations of Salicornia perennans Willd. subsp. perennans are underway thanks to the demand coming from restaurants. In total, we documented 214 taxa (58 families) and at least 19 of them are enduring components of the local diet. Nineteen species represent a high number, considering that the tertiary sector is nowadays predominant in Apulia (73.5 % of the local GDP, compared to 73.2 % in Italy as a whole). Furthermore, the total amount of wild species used as food is the highest in Italy, according to the Italian ethnobotanical literature. On the same basis, we were able to draft a national checklist of 539 taxa documenting the taxonomy of the wild plants involved in traditional food use in Italy, categorized by regions. In conclusion, this work shows that the available literature regarding the Italian territory provides only a partial representation of traditional food uses, even though they are widespread throughout the country. Consequently, this tradition remains to be thoroughly investigated.},

 abstract = {Increase in world population, extreme weather conditions, decrease in fresh water supplies, and changes of dietary habits are major issues that affect global food security. We are expected to face the challenges of land use by 2050 because population will reach 9 billion while agricultural productivity losses are expected due to overuse of lands. How can we feed the next generations in a manner that respects our finite natural resources? Managing our resources in a sustainable way have only begun for selected crops. Much remains to be done to increase food yield. Cropping practices capable of sustainable production need to be elaborated, especially in fragile ecosystems. Typical applications will include the improvement and use of genetic resources; crop management and diversification; diffusion of improved varieties; development of cropping systems; sustainable cropping systems for areas prone to environmental degradation; use of agro-ecological data for crop production forecasting; and networks for regional coordination, and data exchange. The impetus behind this book is to bring attention to a cropping system that bear direct relevance to sustainable agriculture and food security. â€œUnderutilizedâ€ crops are found in numerous agricultural ecosystems and often survive mainly in marginal areas. It is timely to review their status because, in recent decades, scientific and economic interests have emerged which focus on lesser-known cultivated species. Underutilized crops have a great potential to alleviate hunger directly, through increasing food production in challenging environments where major crops are severely limited. â€œGlobal Perspectives on Underutilized Cropsâ€ is therefore topical and highlights the unmet agricultural challenges that we face today. This book is an important resource for students and researchers of crop science and agricultural policy makers.},

 abstract = {Species that belong to the Aphidius eadyi group have been used as biocontrol agents against Acyrthosiphon pisum worldwide. However, despite their extensive use, there are still gaps in our knowledge about their taxonomy and distribution. In this study, we employed an integrative taxonomic approach by combining genetic analyses (mtDNA COI barcoding) with standard morphological analyses and geometric morphometrics of forewing shape. We identified three species within the A. eadyi species group, viz., A. smithi, A. eadyi and A. banksae. Genetic separation of all three species was confirmed, with mean genetic distances between species ranging from 5 to 7.4%. The following morphological characters were determined as the most important for separating species of the A. eadyi group: number and shape of costulae on the anterolateral part of the petiole, shape of the central areola on the propodeum, and shape and venation of the forewings. The differences in wing shape of all three species were statistically significant, but with some overlapping. We identified A. banksae as a widely distributed pea aphid parasitoid, whose known range covers most of the western Palaearctic (from the UK to Israel). Aphidius banksae is diagnosed and redescribed.},

However, the susceptibility of several of the forage legumes to the specialist pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) has never been investigated. The present study on aphid probing behaviour using the Electrical Penetration Graph technique revealed that the forage legumes studied were (i) highly acceptable (common vetch Vicia sativa L.), (ii) acceptable (wooly vetch Vicia villosa Roth), (iii) moderately acceptable (fodder galega Galega orientalis Lam., crimson clover Trifolium incarnatum L., Persian clover Trifolium resupinatum L., white clover Trifolium repens L.), (iv) barely acceptable (common birdâ€™s-foot-trefoil Lotus corniculatus L., yellow lucerne Medicago falcata L., alfalfa Medicago sativa L., sand lucerne Medicago Ã— varia Martyn, common birdâ€™s-foot Ornithopus sativus Brot., alsike clover Trifolium hybridum L., red clover Trifolium pratense L., common sainfoin Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.), and (v) unacceptable (white melilot Melilotus albus Medik.) to the pea aphid. On (i) plants, probing occupied 85% of experimental time, all aphids (100%) succeeded in feeding on phloem sap, phloem phase occupied 50% of probing time, sap ingestion periods were long (mean duration: 100.8 Â± 28.2 min.) and engaged 97% of the phloem phase. On (ii) plants, probing occupied 73% of exp. time, feeding activity occurred in 66.7% of aphids, phloem phase occupied 30% of probing time, sap ingestion periods were long (mean duration: 115.5 Â± 46.7 min) and engaged 80% of the phloem phase. On (iii) plants, probing ranged from 53% of exp. time on T. repens to 70% on T. incarnatum and T. resuspinatum, feeding occurred in 35.3% of aphids on T. resuspinatum up to 54.5% on T. incarnatum, phloem phase occupied 10% of exp. time on G. orientalis, T. incarnatum, and T. resuspinatum and 20% on T. repens, sap ingestion periods were from 9.8 Â± 1.8 min. on G. orientalis to 51.9 Â± 20.7 min. long on T. resuspinatum and engaged from 30% of phloem phase on G. orientalis to 80% on T. incarnatum.

On M. albus (v), probing occupied 22% of experimental time, the probes were short (1.8 Â± 0.3 min), and no aphid on M. albus showed feeding on phloem sap. M. albus can be recommended for intercropping, â€˜push-pullâ€™ strategies, or as a barrier crop against A. pisum in sustainable agricultural practices.},

 abstract = {Protein-rich grain legumes are grown for both human food and animal feed, and their multiple benefits to the environment. Pea (Pisum sativum) is the most widely cultivated grain legume in Europe. In the world, several field experiments have compared the yields of a broad range of grain legumes in contrasting environments, but these experiments have never been synthesized. We address two questions: 1) What is the yield levels of pea compared to other grain legume species in Europe? 2) Which grain legume species with good yield performances in North America and Oceania are candidates for future European experiments? We conducted a statistical analysis of five variables â€“ grain yield, total aerial biomass, grain crude protein, grain gross energy, grain nitrogen content â€“ comparing 22 grain legume species with pea, based on experimental data extracted from 61 peer-reviewed articles and nutritional data. We identify soybean (Glycine max), narrowleaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), and faba bean (Vicia faba), as alternative grain legumes to pea in Europe. Grain legume species grown in North America do not outperform pea for most of the criteria. In Oceania, faba bean has significantly higher yield than pea, whereas several species do not differ significantly from pea. Based on data collected in North America and Oceania, we suggest assessing the relative productivities of several vetches and lupins (Lathyrus, Lupinus, and Vicia species) in European experiments. Our findings reveal new insights into the yields of as yet underexploited grain legume species for potential future use in Europe.},

 abstract = {Plant-parasitic nematodes are recognized as one of the greatest threats to crop production throughout the world. Estimated annual crop losses of $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide are attributed to plant parasitic nematodes. Plant parasitic nematodes not only cause damage individually but form disease-complexes with other microorganisms thereby increasing crop loss. Nematode diseases of crops are difficult to control because of their insidious nature and lack of specific diagnostic symptoms which closely resemble those caused by other plant pathogens and abiotic diseases. Future developments of sustainable management systems for preventing major economical agricultural losses due to nematodes is focused on strategies that limit production costs, enhance crop yields, and protect the environment. This book presents a first compendium and overview for nematode problems and their management across North America. Each chapter provides essential information on the occurrence and distribution of plant parasitic nematodes, their major crop hosts, impact on crop production and sustainable management strategies for each region of the continent including, Canada, Mexico and all states of the USA. For each region, a thematic overview of changes in crop production affected by plant parasitic nematodes and their management strategies over time will provide invaluable information on the important role of plant parasitic nematodes in sustainable agriculture.},

 abstract = {Main conclusionAlthough grass pea is an environmentally successful robust legume with major traits of interest for food and nutrition security, the genetic potential of this orphan crop has long been neglected.Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a Neolithic plant that has survived millennia of cultivation and has spread over three continents. It is a robust legume crop that is considered one of the most resilient to climate changes and to be survival food during drought-triggered famines. The hardy penetrating root system allows the cultivation of grass pea in various soil types, including marginal ones. As an efficient nitrogen fixer, it meets its own nitrogen requirements and positively benefits subsequent crops. However, already in ancient India and Greece, overconsumption of the seeds and a crippling neurological disorder, later coined neurolathyrism, had been linked. Overemphasis of their suspected toxic properties has led to disregard the plantâ€™s exceptionally positive agronomic properties and dietary advantages. In normal socio-economic and environmental situations, in which grass pea is part of a balanced diet, neurolathyrism is virtually non-existent. The etiology of neurolathyrism has been oversimplified and the deficiency in methionine in the diet has been overlooked. In view of the global climate change, this very adaptable and nutritious orphan crop deserves more attention. Grass pea can become a wonder crop if the double stigma on its reputation as a toxic plant and as food of the poor can be disregarded. Additionally, recent research has exposed the potential of grass pea as a health-promoting nutraceutical. Development of varieties with an improved balance in essential amino acids and diet may be relevant to enhance the nutritional value without jeopardizing the multiple stress tolerance of this promising crop.},

 abstract = {Vicia narbonensis is one of the annual leguminous species with the potential to become an important grain and straw crop for animal feeding. In this study, we evaluated the reproductive potentialities of two introduced accessions of V. narbonensis L. through two experiments: bagging and free pollination. The plants fertility was estimated by the number of flowers giving pods and the number of seeds by flowers. Statistical analysis showed that the two accessions were preferentially autogamous (mean pods/flowersâ€‰ratio =â€‰0.6). Significant differences were observed for the number of flowers and pods per plant and the number of seeds per pod. Significant correlations were obtained between the fertility rate and the pods number by plant. Accession VN1 had a lower fertility rate than VN9 (0.47 vs 0.71) under strictly self-fertilization conditions due to the low viability of its pollen. Results allowed a better characterization of the two Narbon vetch accessions, which may contribute to the conservation of its genetic resources considering its drought tolerance and its potential as a feed legume crop in dry areas.

 abstract = {Purpose. Analysis of domestic and foreign literature on the role of alternative weed hosts of phytonematode families Heteroderidae and Meloidogynidae. Results. The nematodes of the Heteroderidae family can be hosted by 350 species of weeds from 40 families and 155 genera. Most of these weeds belong to five families: Chenopodiaceae (37 species from three genera), Solanaceae (44 species from 6 genera), Poaceae (47 species from 24 genera), Brassicaceae (67 species from 29 genera) and Fabaceae (85 species out of 25 genera) and have a total of 280 species of 87 genera. Weeds belonging to the families Lathurus (13 species), Vicia (15 species), Chenopodium (14 species) and Solanum (30 species) generally comprise 72 nematode host species. All other genera have fewer than 10 species of weed hosts. Nematodes of the Meloidogynidae family can be hosted by 994 weed species from 118 families and 487 genera. The greatest number of weeds that host parasitic nematodes belong to five families: Fabaceae (308 species), Asteraceae (267 species), Poaceae (8 species), Solanaceae (155 species) and Amaranthaceae (89) and among the families Solanum (61 species), Amaranthus (40 species), Trifolium (36 species), Nicotiana (30 species), Chenopodium and Euphorbia (each 28 species). Conclusions . In order to develop a joint strategy of effective protection of crops from weeds and parasitic nematode species, the biological and ecological characteristics of these harmful organisms should be thoroughly studied and the factors that would reduce their negative impact on plants and prevent crop losses to establish should be found.},

Genetic mapping of genes and QTLs has broadened the scope of marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning in almost all major pulse crops. Genetic transformation, particularly using alien genes conferring resistance to herbicide, insects and diseases has facilitated the development of a huge number of genetically modified varieties of the major pulse crops. Since the genome sequencing of rice in 2002, genomes of over 7 pulse crops have been sequenced. This has resulted in the possibility of deciphering the exact nucleotide sequence and chromosomal positions of agroeconomic genes. Most importantly, comparative genomics and genotyping-by-sequencing has opened up a new vista for exploring wild crop relatives for identification of useful donor genes.},

 abstract = {Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) is a hardy legume grown for food, feed, and fodder. It is an ancient crop which has been cultivated for more than 8000Â years because of its tolerance of drought, flooding, salinity, and poor soils, its ability to fix nitrogen, and its seeds with high levels of protein. These traits make it an outstanding crop for ensuring nutritional security (particularly for protein) for resource-poor farmers, especially in the face of impending changes in climate. However, the presence of Î²-N-oxalyl-L-Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid (Î²-ODAP or ODAP), a neurotoxin present in the seeds and vegetative tissues of grass pea, has limited its breeding and modern-day cultivation. Î²-ODAP causes lathyrism, a paralysis of the lower limbs that occurs in epidemics in undernourished communities. This has resulted in grass pea being an â€œorphan cropâ€ whose potential has not been fully realized due to lack of markets and research funding. The recent emphasis on climate smart crops has refocused attention on this very promising crop. Genomic resources and low-ODAP lines are being developed, and it is hoped that these will soon allow grass pea to reach its full potential as a resilient protein crop for food and nutritional security through sustainable agriculture in the face of climate change.},

Among them, pulse production is subject to strong lock-in compared to soya, the leading worldwide crop. To unlock the situation and foster more grain-legume crop diversity, scientific research is essential for providing new knowledge that may lead to new development. Our study aimed to evaluate whether research activity on grain-legumes is also locked in favor of soya. Considering more than 80 names grouped into 19 main grain-legume species, we built a dataset of 107,823 scholarly publications (articles, book, and book chapters) between 1980 and 2018 retrieved from the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) reflecting the research activity on grain-legumes. We delineated 10 scientific themes of interest running the gamut of agrofood research (e.g., genetics, agronomy, and nutrition). We indexed grain-legume species, calculated the percentage of records for each one, and conducted several analyses longitudinally and by country. Globally, we found an unbalanced research output: soya remains the main crop studied, even in the promising field of food sciences advanced by FAO as the â€œfuture of pulsesâ€. Our results raise questions about how to align research priorities with societal demand for more crop diversity.},

 abstract = {Pulses, defined as legumes which produce dry seed used for human consumption, are plants of great agronomic value, at the food system level as much as the field level but their diversity has been largely underused. This study aimed at analyzing existing data on cultivated pulse species in the literature to provide a broad and structured description of pulsesâ€™ interspecific functional diversity. We used a functional trait-based approach to evaluate how pulse diversity could support food production in agroecosystems constrained by low water and nutrient availability and exposed to high weed pressure. We gathered data for 17 functional traits and six agroecosystem properties for 43 pulse species. Our analytical framework highlights the correlations and combinations of functional traits that best predict values of six agroecosystem properties defined as ecosystem services estimates. We show that pulse diversity has been structured both by breeding and by an environmental gradient. The covariance space corresponding to agroecosystem properties was structured by three properties: producers, competitors, stress-tolerant species. The distribution of crop species in this functional space reflected ecological adaptive strategies described in wild species, where the size-related axis of variation is separated from variation of leaf morpho-physiological traits. Six agroecosystem properties were predicted by different combinations of traits. However, we identified ubiquitous plant traits such as leaflet length, days to maturity, seed weight, and leaf nitrogen content, that discriminated agroecosystem properties and allowed us to gather individual species into three clusters, representative of the three strategies highlighted earlier. Implications for pulses provisioning of services in agroecosystems are discussed.},

Forage samples were collected five times by 15-day intervals from the before-flowering stage to the after-flowering stage in 2015 and 2016. The total number of species was 105 species belonging to 73 genera and related to 26 families. Of the total species, 20 were from Poaceae (19.0%), 30 were from Poaceae (28.6%). Rests of the species belonged to other families (52.4%) dominated by families such as Asteraceae (13/55) and Lamiaceae (6/55), of which 26 species were weeds harmful to animals. While the percentages of decreaser, increaser and invader species were 16.2, 12.4 and 71.4, those of annual, biennial and perennial species were 31.9, 2.9 and 65.2, respectively. The number of species preferred by grazing was 74 (70.5%), while the number of non-preferable species was 31 (29.5%). The ME (MJ kg-1), RFQ and quality category of legumes, grass, and other botanical families were found as 8.88Â±0.07, 130.9Â±3.05 and very good, 8.00Â±0.07, 83.2Â±1.62 and good, and 8.98Â±0.07, 141.0Â±3.62 and premium, respectively. These results can be used as a management tool to improve rangeland quality and sustainability. The evidence from this study is that floristic pattern is not merely a result of invader forage species, but also might be a beneficial result that deserves further study for mountainous rangelands.},

In particular, pottery vessels offer an unparalleled comparative framework for the study of food preparation and consumption, since pottery is used for a variety of domestic food-related activities, including storage, processing and serving. This study illustrates the potential of microbotanical remains to provide a holistic approach to the plant food preparation and consumption cycleâ€”from storage to disposalâ€”through the analysis of starch grains and phytoliths from Late Minoan storage, cooking and serving vessels recently uncovered at the Knossian â€˜neighbourhoodâ€™ of Lower Gypsades. The results show that starch grains and phytoliths are more abundant and diverse in cooking vessels, presumably reflecting a higher deposition of microbotanical remains as a result of the disturbance caused by cooking. The results further offer insights into Minoan storage and cooking practices at Gypsades, suggesting that cereals were stored de-husked in pithoi and, possibly, in palm leaf baskets, and later cooked together with non-staple plants. The virtual absence of microbotanical remains from serving vessels may be due to depositional factors and/or the fact that some of the vessels analysed in this study were used for serving/consuming liquids or animal products, and not plants.},

For this purpose, we based our investigation on the analysis of a recently acquired dataset and on the European list of rare and threatened arable plants. We highlight how different species of conservation interest tend to occur in the same community. On the other hand, generalist and more competitive taxa show similar patterns of co-occurrence. We suggest that single species of conservation value could be suitable indicators of a well-preserved community. On the other hand, to be effective, conservation strategies should target the whole community, rather than single species.},

 abstract = {Abstract
                  Enabling food security requires access to a broad range of genetic resources to facilitate crop breeding. This need is increased in a climate change scenario, which will require the production of novel crops adapted to new conditions. However, many major crops have reduced genetic diversity due to the genetic bottlenecks that they have experienced during their domestication and subsequent breeding. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) remain underexploited in plant breeding programmes, mostly because of the lack of knowledge of their cross-compatibility with crops. In this study, we use a combination of phylogenetic distance metrics, cytogenetic compatibility data (e.g. chromosome number and ploidy) and information about breeding systems to predict interspecific cross-compatibility between crop and wild species and hence identify crop wild phylorelatives (CWPs) (i.e. CWRs that can breed with the crop). We illustrate this concept using cultivated asparagus as a model by integrating previous cross-compatibility knowledge and CWR classifications into a phylogenetic framework reconstructed using available sequence data. Our approach aims to reinforce the use of the gene pool classification system of CWRs of Harlan and De Wet, since CWPs are estimated to belong to the secondary gene pool and non-CWPs to the tertiary gene pool. Identifying CWPs unlocks novel uses of genetic resources, although such data are available for less than half of the known CWRs (43.4% with sequence data and 32.5% with known ploidy). The need to conserve plants that provide or enhance provisioning ecosystem services, including CWRs, is clear if we are to rise to the global challenge of ensuring food security for all. However, basic knowledge about their conservation status is still lacking, with only c. 20% of CWRs assigned an IUCN red list assessment, 23% of which are Data Deficient (DD). Using the CWP classification presented here to define CWRs will contribute towards helping to prioritize CWRs for IUCN assessments and, where prioritised, conservation.},

 abstract = {Management and distribution of experimental data from prebreeding projects is important to ensure uptake of germplasm into breeding and research programs. Being able to access and share this data in standard formats is essential. The adoption of a common informatics platform for crops that may have limited resources brings economies of scale, allowing common informatics components to be used across multiple species. The close integration of such a platform with commonly used breeding software, visualization, and analysis tools reduces the barrier for entry to researchers and provides a common framework to facilitate collaborations and data sharing. This work presents significant updates to the Germinate platform and highlights its value in distributing prebreeding data for 14 crops as part of the project â€˜Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relativesâ€™ (hereafter Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project) led by the Crop Trust (https://www.cwrdiversity.org). The addition of data on these species compliments data already publicly available in Germinate. We present a suite of updated Germinate features using examples from these crop species and their wild relatives. The use of Germinate within the Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project demonstrates the usefulness of the system and the benefits a shared informatics platform provides.

 abstract = {Phoma koolunga is one of three species that cause ascochyta blight (synonym: blackspot) of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) in Australia. P. koolunga was first described in 2009 in South Australia and has since been reported in Western Australia and Victoria. However, the origin of the pathogen and its host range remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the host range of P. koolunga and to explore possible origin(s) of P. koolunga as a pathogen of field pea in Australia. Host range experiments were conducted in a growth room using 41 legumes comprising Australian native, naturalised, crop and pasture legumes, and wild type Pisum, Lathyrus and Vicia spp. Two isolates of P. koolunga from field pea in South Australia were compared. Disease incidence and severity were measured as number of leaves and percentage of leaf area diseased every 4Â days up to 12Â days post-inoculation. All legumes tested, except Cicer arietinum (chickpea), developed leaf lesions and some also had stem lesions. Disease incidence and severity differed significantly among species but not consistently between the P. koolunga isolates. The ability of the isolates to cause lesions on a wide range of legumes in controlled environment conditions suggests the fungus has a broad host range in humid and mild temperature conditions conducive for disease development. These results provide no evidence to suggest P. koolunga could have evolved with any of the 17 Australian native legume species tested and the fungus is, therefore, unlikely to have originated within Australia.},

Grain yield of cultivated species of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is almost negligible at the highest infection severity of Orobanche. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) have emerged as a novel source for many traits in diverse crops. Lathyrus is one of the largest genera with more than 160 species. In the present study, we screened 285 accessions representing 13 Lathyrus species for their reactions against two common broomrape species, Orobanche crenata Forsk. and O. foetida Poir, under field conditions. Screening at hot spots in Morocco and Tunisia resulted in the identification of resistant accessions of wild Lathyrus species against the parasitic weed. The level of resistance to O. foetida was higher among wild species compared with O. crenata. Field results showed complete resistance for O. crenata and O. foetida by L. articulatus L. and moderate resistance by L. aphaca L. and L. ochrus (L.) DC. Resistance to O. crenata in L. sativus accessions was validated in a pot experiment under controlled conditions. Two accessionsâ€”namely, IG64782 and IG65197â€”showed complete resistance to O. crenata. A moderately resistant accession, IG116989, that revealed low infestation in the field showed high susceptibility in pot experiment. The results indicated that the resistance against O. crenata and O. foetida was associated with slow development of the established tubercles and low induction of parasite germination. Crop wild relatives are great source of novel traits/alleles Complete resistance to parasitic weeds Orobanche exists in wild relatives of grass pea Underground Orobanche attachments needs to be included inthe screening for Orobanche resistance},

 abstract = {Lectins are of prime importance due to the reversibility and specificity in their sugar-binding properties, which differ from enzymes or antibodies in being non-catalytic and mostly weak in nature with broader specificity. There are several approaches which help to characterize these interactions in terms of thermodynamic parameters like affinity constant, binding stoichiometry, free energy change, enthalpy change, and the change in entropy of the interaction. These techniques range from the simple hapten inhibition assay to determine the sugar specificity to the more advanced methods like fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance that helps to determine the binding parameters.Sugars are mysterious molecules of biological systems due to the challenges in predicting their sequence and the complexities in terms of chain length, type of sugar, branching, and anomerism. There are a variety of glycans on cell surfaces of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which can be targeted to identify the cell types. Lectin binding to cell surface may induce downstream pathways, leading to cell death via complement-mediated lysis, leakage of nutrients, poor nutrient absorption, apoptosis, or cell cycle arrest. This property makes them very good antimicrobial, anti-insect, and anticancer agents. Some lectins can induce cell division, as observed in case of certain mitogenic lectins. This chapter addresses the techniques used widely to understand the thermodynamic parameters of lectinâ€“sugar interaction and discuss the role of this binding in the cytotoxic and mitogenic potential of these proteins. Analytical uses of lectins as affinity matrixes, lectin blotting, lectin microarray, enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), and lectin-based biosensor are also briefly outlined.},

 abstract = {Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a grown in fragile agro-ecosystems as it can withstand extreme drought, waterlogging, salinity, and heat with no major threats from diseases and insect pests in fields. Despite many benefits, grass pea is underutilized and underresearched because of three main reasonsâ€”presence of a plant toxin, nature of pollination, and large genome size. The presence of Î²-N-oxalyl-l-Î±,Î² diaminopropionic acid (Î²-ODAP), poses a serious challenge to its cultivation as it gained a reputation that its consumption can cause neurodegenerative disease in humans. However, the crop has recently received recognition as a health promoting functional as a healthy smart food in spite of the presence the of Î²-ODAP. Classical breeding schemes have successfully developed ~30 improved varieties that are grown in various agroecologies in different parts of the world. With emphasis on plant-based protein diets and adaptation to climate change, grass pea has gained importance as important legume crop in recent years. This has encouraged many research teams around the world to generate knowledge on various aspects of priority traits, their mechanisms, and how to use that knowledge in improving grass pea genetically. The renewed interest in grass pea is also due to emphasis on diversification of cereal-based cropping systems that are unsustainable in long run. Recent advances in efficient tools and techniques for genomics, phenomics, and breeding have led to overcome some of the technological issues in grass pea. The availability of the draft genome sequence has placed grass pea, at the threshold for the generation of abundant genomic resources for use in genomics enabled advancement. We review current status and prospects of grass pea and various breeding approaches to improve this crop for its integration in diverse and sustainable agri-food systems.},

 abstract = {Lathyrus (Lathyrussativus L.) is an important legume crop with low cost and easy cultivation grown in India, Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, Nepal, and Pakistan for human food and animal feed. Inherently Lathyrus possesses resistance to drought, excess moisture, salinity, diseases, and insect pests. As Lathyrus has an ambivalent reputation due to ODAP content in its plant parts, efforts are on to develop low or ODAP free Lathyrus varieties with high biomass for dual purpose for human food and animal feed. Older published animal feeding studies are of limited use, since the presence and role of ODAP was unknown until the 1960s. More recent feeding studies indicate that low ODAP lines of L. sativus can be safely incorporated at inclusion rates up to 40, 30 and 70% of the diet of poultry, pigs and sheep, respectively, without growth reductions (Hanbury, et al, 2000). Lathyrus is known as excellent feed and fodder crop for centuries as a main concentrate for horses (Anonymous, 1894). Livestock is a key component of farming systems in South Asia and in Africa, and most particularly with small and marginal farmers, estimated about 678 million, and indicates importance of livestock to their livelihoods (ILRI, 2000). Lathyrus is increasingly recognized as an important feed and fodder crop by the resource poor farmers of semi-arid and dry areas. Acceptability of low ODAP varieties by the farmers of non-traditional Lathyrus growing areas and high nutritional composition makes the Lathyrus a perfect dual purpose for crop securing food, feed and fodder security in the region. (Sarkar, et al., 2010). As world demand for legume feed protein is likely to increase, due to increasing demand for animal food products, L. sativus are crops that should be considered in regions with suitable environments (Hanbury, et al, 2016).},

It is of utmost importance that the neglected and underutilized legumes (NULs) are identified and utilized as source of germane genes and gene-products, through concerted research platforms. In the present article, we analyzed the current status of NULs with specific emphasis to the potent utility of grasspea owing to its unique characters including stress adaptation, nutritional superiority and ease of cultivation. We have highlighted the landmarks in the history of grasspea, delineating the rapid progress achieved in grasspea biology during the past decades. Despite possession of a neurotoxic compound, Î²-N-oxalyl-L-Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid (Î²-ODAP), this neglected legume outshines most food crops with its distinct physicochemical attributes, health and agricultural benefits and resilience to environmental constraints. With the availability of genome sequence, grasspea is now established as an appropriate genetic resource for sustainable agriculture and phytoremediation rendering its genes, proteins and metabolites for targeted genetic manipulation. We conclude that grasspea would serve as a resource for plant translational genomics (TG) research, particularly resilience of legumes to environmental challenges.},

This study investigated how workers' descriptive data (age, job experience, attitudes) and specific organizational variables (how work crews are structured) potentially facilitate SH in an agricultural setting. Harassment was reported by 30% of surveyed female viticulture workers in their current jobs. Harassed women tended to be younger, employed seasonally and working in crews where hostile sexist views were prevalent. Harassment affected worker productivity; harassed women and their male co-workers were less satisfied with their jobs and more likely to seek other employment. Efforts to address SH by restructuring at the level of the field crew may be ineffective. Instead, addressing workers' hostile sexist attitudes and the extent to which an organization tolerates SH appears to have the most promise for reducing SH in agricultural industries.},

 abstract = {Grass pea is well-established as one of the most resilient and versatile crops that can thrive under extreme climatic circumstances such as cold, heat, drought, salt-affected soils, submergence, and excessive rainfall along with resistance to several diseases and pests. However, despite the awareness of its virtues, its cultivation globally has decreased recently owing to the presence of a neurotoxin, Î²-N-oxalyl-L-Î±, Î²-diaminopropionic acid (Î²-ODAP), in the seedlings and seeds of this legume, which has been reported to cause neurolathyrism, a non-reversible neurological disorder in humans and animals. Significant repositories of <i>Lathyrus</i> germplasm are available across countries that have provided access to a wide range of agro-morphological traits as well as the low Î² ODAP content. Efforts have been made worldwide to use these germplasms for the genetic enhancement of grass pea to make this food safe for human consumption. Efforts on molecular breeding of this crop are also lagging. However, during the last decade, the research scenario has changed with some efforts being made toward improving this climate resilient pulse in terms of genomic resources. Molecular markers have also been used to evaluate the interspecific diversity as well as the phylogenetic relationship among the species and mapping studies. Intron-targeted amplified polymorphic, genomic simple sequence repeat, resistance genes analogs, and disease resistance markers developed for other legume species have been successfully cross-amplified in grass pea. Transcriptomic studies have recently been undertaken on grass pea by deploying several second-generation sequencing techniques. In addition, a few studies have attempted to unveil the genes and the underlying mechanism conferring biotic and abiotic stress or regulating the pathway of Î²-ODAP in grass pea. Proteomics has accelerated the identification studies on differential proteomes in response to salinity and low-temperature stress conditions for unveiling the common signaling pathways involved in mitigating these abiotic stresses and in discovering differentially regulated proteins. In grass pea, a metabolomics approach has been used to identify the metabolic processes associated with Î²-ODAP synthesis. Genome sequencing of grass pea is under way which is expected to be vital for whole-genome re-sequencing and gene annotation toward the identification of genes with novel functions. Recently, a draft genome sequence of grass pea was developed, and some efforts are underway to re-sequence a diverse panel of grass pea comprising 384 germplasm lines. Owing to the scantiness of a successful transformation protocol, research on the application of modern approaches of genome editing like the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) or CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system for the engineering of signaling pathways or regulatory mechanisms seeks immediate attention to reduce the Î²-ODAP content in seeds and to improve the potential agronomic traits in grass pea.},

 abstract = {The management of agroecosystems affects biodiversity at all levels from genetic to food-web complexity. Low-input farming systems support higher levels of genetic, species and habitat diversity than high-input, industrial ones. In Greece, as in other Mediterranean countries, the role of traditional farming practices has been underlined in studies concerning conservation in agricultural landscapes. With this study, we aim to provide evidence for the potential of semi-extensive farming for biodiversity conservation at landscape-scale, focusing on Lemnos, a medium-sized island in the North Aegean. Evidence was gathered by species- and community-level local-scale surveys on various trophic levels (vascular plants, arthropods, birds). The surveys took place in 2018 and 2019 in 25 sampling areas comprising 106 plots of 100Â m<sup>2</sup> (vascular plants, arthropods) and 57 points where bird species were recorded. The plots were classified into three landscape types: mosaic agriculture, mixed rangelands and uniform rangelands. The relevÃ©s of Lemnos farmlands were assigned to plant communities of 18 phytosociological alliances, grouped into 12 classes. The most abundant arthropods were Coleoptera, Chilopoda, and Hymenoptera, followed by Opiliones and Isopoda, while 133 different bird species were recorded in total, including the recording for the first time on the island of five species. Farming on Lemnos is rather extensive compared to most agricultural landscapes of Europe. Our approach has demonstrated that, given the geographic characteristics of the area, the measured data reveal very high biodiversity. Our explorative findings suggest that moderate seasonal grazing, the mixed habitat mosaic with ecotones, fallow and stubble fields at the landscape scale, and the small size of fields, the kinds of crop, and farm-scale crop diversification, like mixed cultivation and crop rotation, are key practices supporting this diversity. These explorative findings are considered as a first step providing the baseline for future assessments. A wider effort, for systematic evaluation of the impacts of farming practices to biodiversity, is required, as part of a subsidized agri-environmental scheme and/or through a market-oriented product certification system for the area.},

 abstract = {Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a legume crop known to be an excellent source of protein, tolerant to drought, waterlogging, and salinity. The crop is used as an alternative source of protein to reduce malnutrition for resource-poor people and farmers leaving in marginal areas. However, due to the presence of a neurotoxin that causes lathyrism in the crop, it has been neglected and underutilized. As a necessary first step towards, therefore, this investigation was undertaken to assess the genetic diversity and population structure that existed within grass pea accessions collected from North-West Ethiopia using simple sequence repeat markers. Twenty-five grass pea accessions collected from the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute were planted at the College of Agricultural Science, Ebonyi State University, Nigeria. The genomic DNA was extracted using Quick-DNAâ„¢ ZR Plant/Seed Miniprep Kit and amplified in an ABI Veriti PCR machine with 10 pairs of SSR markers in IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria. Out of 10 SSR primers, only eight primers were polymorphic. A total of 41 alleles were detected with an average of 5.13. The Polymorphism Information Content and Gene Diversity values ranged from 0.074 to 0.944 with a mean of 0.474 and 0.536 respectively. The largest pairwise genetic distance (0.365) was detected between North Gondar and East Gojjam populations. The Ð¤PT (analog of FST test) estimated through AMOVA were 0.24, 0.20, and 0.05 for within accessions, among regions, and population within regions respectively. The highest genetic differentiation value (76%) resides within accessions followed by 20% among regions. Both the population structure and cluster analyses grouped the 25 grass pea accessions into two distinct subgroups. This grouping pattern indicates the presence of gene flow among geographic regions. In general, the findings of this study indicate that despite few numbers of SSR markers it was possible to detect genetic diversity among grass pea accessions indicating the power of the SSR marker in picking up the existing genetic diversity within the studied accessions.},

 abstract = {The genus <i>Lathyrus</i> consists of more than 184 herbaceous annual and perennial species suitable for multifaceted sustainable food and feed production system in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The grasspea is a promising source of protein nutrition. However, its potential is not being utilized fully due to the presence of neurotoxin content (Î²-N-oxalyl-l-Î±, Î² diaminopropionic acid, Î²-ODAP), a causal agent of non-reversible lower limbs paralysis. The high protein contents in seeds and leaves with ~90% digestibility make it sustainable super food to beat protein malnutrition in future. Therefore, it is desired to breed new grasspea cultivars with low Î²-ODAP contents. Limited research has been carried out to date about this feature. A draft genome sequence of grasspea has been recently published that is expected to play a vital role in breeding and identifying the genes responsible for biosynthesis pathway of Î²-ODAP contents in grasspea. Efforts to increase awareness about the importance of genus <i>Lathyrus</i> and detoxify Î²-ODAP in grasspea are desired and are in progress. Presently, in South Asia, systematic and dedicated efforts to support the farmers in the grasspea growing regions by disseminating low Î²-ODAP varieties has resulted in a considerable improvement in reducing the incidence of neurolathyrism. It is expected that the situation will improve further by mainstreaming grasspea cultivation by implementing different approaches such as the development and use of low Î²-ODAP varieties, strengthening government policies and improved detox methods. The present review provides insight into the multifaceted characteristics of sustainable nutritious grasspea in the global and Indian perspective.},

 abstract = {Grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a cool-season legume crop with a broad range of genetic diversity prevalent across the continents. Grasspea is an underutilized source of calories and protein for populations residing in areas with frequent droughts and marginal areas of Asia, Africa and in few pockets of Australia. It is a viable crop option for agro-ecosystems, where successful cultivation of major crop species is difficult especially under the changing scenario of climate change. The major constraint in grasspea production is a neurotoxin known as Î²-N-oxalyl-l-Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid known as (Î²-ODAP) causing neurolathyrism, a neurotoxic disease in humans, thus making it unfit for the human consumption. The strategic reduction of ODAP through genetic manipulation is the sole option to obtain the benefits of this â€œorphan cropâ€. Lathyrus genetic resources in large ex situ collections have been done in various gene banks of the world by undertaking collection, conservation, evaluation, characterization and utilization. It has found that no significant efforts have been made for alien gene transfer in grasspea, in spite of a large number of wild relatives with useful traits. The grasspea is well-adapted to a number of biotic stresses but yet incur considerable yield losses of approx. 15â€“25%. Till date, negligible genetic resources have been exploited to develop grasspea genotype resistant against biotic stresses viz. diseases and pests. Foliar diseases are predominantly responsible for the substantial yield loss. This chapter reviews the present status of genomic resources of grasspea and their use in developing biotic stress resistant genotypes.},

 abstract = {Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a climate-resistant underused cool season legume crop grown in marginal rainy regions of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and the Mediterranean region, where it is grown for food as well as forage. In the face of climate change and global warming, grass pea is gaining popularity as a more water and input efficient crop with the unique ability to improve soil fertility while emitting little carbon. With deep penetrating root system, grass pea possesses enormous genetic potential for drought, salt and flood tolerance as well as for surviving under waterlogged condition of rice fallow niches. Despite of its immense potential grass pes is still orphan in terms of genetic and genomic resource. Because of the stigma associated with the presence of Î²-ODAP responsible for crippling disease, grass pea cultivation has declined in the recent decade. New research has revealed grass pea's potential as a functional food with presence of health-promoting nutraceutical like homoarginine. Concentrated breeding efforts in grass pea have developed 30 improved varieties with low ODAP content for their cultivation in diverse agro-ecologies. Molecular research is still lagging behind and renewed research is needed for strengthening molecular breeding program in grass pea. Availability of draft genome sequencing is a significant step forward towards the application of genomic-assisted breeding in this crop. Grass pea is the golden pulse of future for diversification of more energy and input intensive cereal-based cropping systems which are not long term viable. This chapter focuses on the redesigning of abiotic stress tolerant grass pea and highlights the research gaps that need to be contemplated to make it as a â€œwonder cropâ€ of future.},

 abstract = {Crenate broomrape (<i>Orobanche crenata</i> Forsk.) is a serious long-standing parasitic weed problem in Algeria, mainly affecting legumes but also vegetable crops. Unresolved questions for parasitic weeds revolve around the extent to which these plants undergo local adaptation, especially with respect to host specialization, which would be expected to be a strong selective factor for obligate parasitic plants. In the present study, the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach was used to analyze genetic diversity and population structure of 10Â Northern Algerian <i>O</i>. <i>crenata</i> populations with different geographical origins and host species (faba bean, pea, chickpea, carrot, and tomato). In total, 8004Â high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (5% missingness) were obtained and used across the study. Genetic diversity and relationships of 95 individuals from 10 populations were studied using model-based ancestry analysis, principal components analysis, discriminant analysis of principal components, and phylogeny approaches. The genetic differentiation (<i>F</i> <sub>ST</sub>) between pairs of populations was lower between adjacent populations and higher between geographically separated ones, but no support was found for isolation by distance. Further analyses identified four genetic clusters and revealed evidence of structuring among populations and, although confounded with location, among hosts. In the clearest example, <i>O</i>. <i>crenata</i> growing on pea had a SNP profile that was distinct from other host/location combinations. These results illustrate the importance and potential of GBS to reveal the dynamics of parasitic weed dispersal and population structure.},

 abstract = {Legume crops, belonging to the Fabaceae family, are of immense importance for sustaining global food security. Many legumes are profitable crops for smallholder farmers due to their unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and their intrinsic ability to thrive on marginal land with minimum inputs and low cultivation costs. Recent progress in genomics shows promise for future genetic gains in major grain legumes. Still it remains limited in minor legumes/underutilized legumes, including adzuki bean, cluster bean, horse gram, lathyrus, red clover, urd bean, and winged bean. In the last decade, unprecedented progress in completing genome assemblies of various legume crops and resequencing efforts of large germplasm collections has helped to identify the underlying gene(s) for various traits of breeding importance for enhancing genetic gain and contributing to developing climate-resilient cultivars. This review discusses the progress of genomic resource development, including genome-wide molecular markers, key breakthroughs in genome sequencing, genetic linkage maps, and trait mapping for facilitating yield improvement in underutilized legumes. We focus on 1) the progress in genomic-assisted breeding, 2) the role of whole-genome resequencing, pangenomes for underpinning the novel genomic variants underlying trait gene(s), 3) how adaptive traits of wild underutilized legumes could be harnessed to develop climate-resilient cultivars, 4) the progress and status of functional genomics resources, deciphering the underlying trait candidate genes with putative function in underutilized legumes 5) and prospects of novel breeding technologies, such as speed breeding, genomic selection, and genome editing. We conclude the review by discussing the scope for genomic resources developed in underutilized legumes to enhance their production and play a critical role in achieving the "zero hunger" sustainable development goal by 2030 set by the United Nations.},

 abstract = {Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a climate-resilient nutrient-dense crop that offers food and nutritional security to many low-income communities of different underdeveloped regions of the worldÂ includingÂ South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Mediterranean region. It is recognized to have a good source of protein, healthy fatty acids, vitamins and micronutrients, notwithstanding, the stigma of neurotoxin (ODAP) associated with grass pea that cause irremediable neurological disorder in humans and animals. Interestingly, it is the only known dietary source of l-homoarginine a non-proteinogenic amino acid which has admirable medicinal properties. It has better tolerance to different biotic and abiotic stresses as compared to other pulse crops. Over the years, sincere efforts are made towards the genetic improvement of grass pea to subsidize ODAP content and elevate production potential. In this book chapter, the economic importance of the crop, its origin, domestication, evolution, botanical description and floral biology have been illustrated. The accomplishment made in grass pea improvement through conventional and non-conventional breeding approaches, that is selection, hybridization, pre-breeding and distant hybridization along with application of mutation breeding have been reviewed. The current status of genomics resources and marker-assisted breeding has also been deliberated. Moreover, the breeding objectives, major constraints and future thrust areas toward exploring cutting-edge tools and technique for enriching grass pea genomic resources have been outlined. Furthermore, the existing coordinated testing system for new entries and quality seed production has also been reviewed in brief. Overall, to accelerate genetic gain in grass pea along with low ODAP embracement, urgent need is being felt to explore recent advanced tools and techniques such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, small RNAomics, epigenomics, interactomics, bioinformatics and genome editing to strengthen the grass pea breeding programme towards its transformation from orphan to main stream crop.},

 abstract = {We combine stable isotope analysis of crop remains with functional ecological analysis of their associated weeds to investigate arable farming strategies at Late Chalcolithic Bakla Tepe and Liman Tepe, western Anatolia. Our results reveal â€˜low-inputâ€™ cultivation practices at both sites, with cereals grown on plots with low soil fertility that received low to moderate levels of manuring. In contrast, water supply was unlikely to have been a limiting factor to crop cultivation. Land management strategies were adapted to the tolerances of different crops, with pulses more intensively manured than cereals at Liman Tepe and barley cultivated on drier soils than glume wheats at both sites. This attests to a spatial differentiation in crop cultivation that resembles the practices of recent farmers in the Aegean engaged in extensive systems of land use. Expanded forms of these agricultural systems were used to amass agrarian wealth by elites occupying the citadels of later Early Bronze Age (EB/EBA) western Anatolia, suggesting that the agroecological foundations of this phenomenon were already in place by the late fourth millennium BC. In contrast to the pronounced wealth inequality visible in EBA citadels, however, we suggest that extensive land use fostered productive equality through cooperation between small-scale households in the Late Chalcolithic. It was only with the emergence of more extended domestic units in the EBA, capable of greater autonomy in arable farming, that disparities in production could be maintained over the long-term. This shift may have contributed to the emergence of social structures designed to dampen arable wealth inequality in the EBA.},
