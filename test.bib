  Abstract = {The current situation of global environmental degradation as a result of anthropogenic activities makes it necessary to open new research lines focused on the causes and effects of the main alterations caused in the ecosystems. One of the most relevant is how the niche dynamics of invasive species change between different geographical areas, since its understanding is key to the early detection and control of future invasions. In this regard, we analyzed the distribution pattern of Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten., a plant of the Asteraceae family originally from the Eurasian region that currently invades wide areas of the world. We estimated its niche shifts between continents using a combination of principal components analysis (PCA) and Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) on an extensive set of data on global presences of its native and invaded ranges from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). A set of bioclimatic variables and the Human Footprint (HFP) with a resolution of 10 km were selected for this purpose. Our results showed that the species has a marked global trend to expand toward warmer climates with less seasonality, although in some regions its invasiveness appears to be less than in others. The models had a good statistical performance and high coherence in relation to the known distribution of the species and allowed us to establish the relative weight of the contribution of each variable used, with the annual temperature and seasonality being the determining factors in the establishment of the species. Likewise, the use of non-climatic variable HFP has provided relevant information to explain the colonizing behavior of the species. The combination of this methodology with an adequate selection of predictor variables represents a very useful tool when focusing efforts and resources for the management of invasive species.},

  Abstract = {Autonomous robotic weeding in grasslands requires robust weed segmentation. Deep learning models can provide solutions to this problem, but they need to be trained on large amounts of images, which in the case of grasslands are notoriously difficult to obtain and manually annotate. In this work we introduce Few-leaf Learning, a concept that facilitates the training of accurate weed segmentation models and can lead to easier generation of weed segmentation datasets with minimal human annotation effort. Our approach builds upon the fact that each plant species within the same field has relatively uniform visual characteristics due to similar environmental influences. Thus, we can train a field-and-day-specific weed segmentation model on synthetic training data stemming from just a handful of annotated weed leaves. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for different fields and for two common grassland weeds: Rumex obtusifolius (broad-leaved dock) and Cirsium vulgare (spear thistle).

In the summer of 2018, a survey was conducted to assess the field host range of the biocontrol agent in New Zealand. A random selection of 18 pasture populations under sheep and/or beef production, where C. vulgare was present, was surveyed to quantify the attack intensity (gall size relative to seedhead size) on C. vulgare, and the attack rate on other thistle weeds within the same population. At each location, seedheads were collected from C. vulgare and all other thistle species (Cardueae) present, which included Cirsium arvense (Californian thistle), Cirsium palustre (marsh thistle), Carduus nutans (nodding thistle), and an Arctium species (burdock). In addition to Cirsium vulgare, the gall fly was recorded on C. arvense (six locations) and C. palustre (one location). The probability of attack on C. arvense was positively correlated with attack intensity on C. vulgare, suggesting that attack on C. arvense is a spill-over effect' occurring where seedheads of C. vulgare are in limited supply.},

  Abstract = {Questions: How can we quantify changes in the distribution and abundance of injurious weed species (Senecio jacobaea, Cirsium vulgare, Cirsium arvense, Rumex obtusifolius, Rumex crispus and Urtica dioica), over long time periods at wide geographical scales? What impact do these species have on plant communities? To what extent are changes driven by anthropogenically induced drivers such as disturbance, eutrophication and management?. Location: Great Britain. Methods: Data from national surveys were used to assess changes in the frequency and abundance of selected weed species between 1978 and 2007. This involved novel method development to create indices of change, and to relate changes in distribution and abundance of these species to plant community diversity and inferred changes in resource availability, disturbance and management. Results: Three of the six weed species became more widespread in GB over this period and all of them increased in abundance (in grasslands, arable habitats, roadsides and streamsides). Patterns were complex and varied by landscape context and habitat type. For most of the species, there were negative relationships between abundance, total plant species richness, grassland, wetland and woodland indicators. Each individual species responds to a different combination of anthropogenic drivers but disturbance, fertility and livestock management significantly influenced most species. Conclusions: The increase in frequency and abundance of weeds over decades has implications for landscape-scale plant diversity, fodder yield and livestock health. This includes reductions in plant species richness, loss of valuable habitat specialists and homogenisation of vegetation communities. Increasing land-use intensity, excessive nutrient input, overgrazing, sward damage, poaching and bare ground in fields and undermanagement or too frequent cutting on linear features may have led to increases in weeds. These weeds do have conservation value so we are not advocating eradication, rather co-existence, without dominance. Land management policy needs to adapt to benefit biodiversity and agricultural productivity.},

A survey of 20 randomly selected pasture populations of C. vulgare was conducted to assess the impact of the gall fly on seed production. Attack by the biocontrol agent reduced the number of seeds per seedhead by 47%, individual seed weight by 21%, and seed germination rate by 30%. Where the biocontrol agent was present, population seed reduction ranged from 11 to 61%. The impact of the gall fly significantly increased from southern to more northern latitudes of C. vulgare populations in New Zealand. This study represents the first post-release assessment of this biocontrol agent and indicates that U. stylata can have a significant impact on the seed production of C. vulgare, especially in northern New Zealand where seedhead attack is greatest.},

  Abstract = {Non-native plant invasions are often catalyzed by wildfires and may alter the structure, function, and composition of ecosystems. Of particular concern are non-native annual grasses that promote increased fire frequency and compete with native vegetation for early season moisture. While these effects are well studied in non-forested ecosystems, relatively few studies document invasions of non-native annual grasses in forested ecosystems. We document non-native plant invasion following repeated high-severity wildfire in mixed-conifer/hardwood forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the Klamath Mountains of northern California. Despite great concern regarding the loss of conifer dominance and transitions to non-forested states related to recent and projected increases in wildfire activity, there is little known about invasions of non-native plant species following fire in this region. Non-native plant species capable of long-distance dispersal had an average total cover of 26% and were ubiquitous across a systematic, gridded sample of twenty 800 m2 plots. Non-native forbs included multiple species of common post-disturbance invaders (e.g. Cirsium vulgare, Senecio sylvaticus, Lactuca serriola). Non-native annual grasses comprised more of the vegetative cover than non-native forbs (17% vs. 9%), and were dominated by two species, Aira caryophyllea and Vulpia myuros, which reached as high as 80% cover. Our findings indicate that non-native annual grasses are a novel stressor that may accelerate projected loss of conifer dominance in the Klamath Mountains by facilitating fire spread and increasing competition for early season soil moisture. Additional monitoring will be crucial to understanding the impacts of non-native plants as fire activity in this region continues to increase.},

  Abstract = {The article presents the results of monitoring syngenetic succession on a toxic substrate of the tailings of the Tyrnyauz tungsten-molybdenum plant in 2001 and 2018. According to the features of succession processes on terraces of different ages, 3 types of ecotopes were distinguished: 1 - automorphic (eluvial) upper slopes; 2 - transit transeluvial of the middle part of the slopes; 3 - transelyuvial-accumulative foothills of the slopes. The delay in the beginning of the phases of succession and the duration of the stages of syngenesis grows in the series 3 <U+2192> 2 <U+2192> 1. In 2018, the state of vegetation cover corresponded to the initial stages of syngenesis and was characterized by a high level of synanthropization and apophytization of the flora. On the lower and middle terraces of the tailing, weeds and intruders dominate, not typical of the zonal flora. On the upper terraces ruderal and pioneer plants are found sporadically. The succession process on the technogenic substrate of the tailings takes place spontaneously and under extreme conditions, the onset of the final stages of natural demutation is problematic. In order to stabilize the technogenic ecotope, it is necessary to carry out the technical stage of recultivation (application of fertile layer on the ground) with the sowing of multi-species grass mixtures, the wild-growing components of which are most tolerant of the extreme substrate (Cirsium vulgare, Centaurea kubanica, Taraxacum officinale, Echium vulgare, Jurinea ciscaucasica, Inula germanica).},

  Abstract = {Invasive alien weed species invasion are observed in areas of Woliata Zone, Southern Nations Nationalities Regional state. However, its distribution and abundance have not been determined. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to assess the distribution of P. hysterophorus, L. camara and A. mexicana in the study area. Data were recorded in a total of 120 quadrants of 5 m x 5 m laid at 10 Km interval on the roadsides. Abundance and distribution of the three selected invasive alien weeds were determined and maps showing these were developed using ArcGIS 9.1 software. A total of 13 invasive weed species that is P. hysterophorus, L. camara, A. Mexicana, Xanthium strumtarium L., Ageratum conyzoides L., Xanthium siponsum L., Cirsium vulgare Savi Ten, Senna didymobotra (Fresen.) Iriwin Bameby, Senna oxdentalis L. link, Casia occidentalis L., Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston, Datura stramonim L., and Ricinus communis L. representing six families were identified in the study area. The result of the study showed that most of the invasive weed species found were belongs to the family Asteraceae followed by Fabaceae. Invasive alien weed species were differently distributed with the relative frequency of 0.83 (P. hysterophorus), 0.83 (L. camara), 0.5 (A. Mexicana), 0.43 (S. oxdentalis), respectively, while the other IAWs were found less distributed. The result indicated that of the total (120) sampling points P. hysterophorus was found on 100 sampling plots (83.3%). The infestation of L. camara was observed in all districts and Sodo town administration of the zone. A. mexicana was absent on 60 (50.0%) of sampling points which are at Ofa, Humbo, and Sodo zuria districts P. hysterophorus has the highest mean abundance value (22.3%) followed by L. camara (10.0%). Invasive Alien Weed Species were observed in different habitats. Roadside and cultivated lands were the two frequently P. hysterophorus infested habitats. P. hysterophorus, L. camara and A. mexicana were found to a threat to the livelihood of the Wolayita farming households. Thus, there is an urgent need for well organized, coordinated and concerned efforts that must be made to control. Further long-term study is needed to verify the impact of P. hysterophorus L. camara and A. mexicana invasion.},

  Abstract = {Invasive social bees can alter plant-pollinator interactions with detrimental effects on both partners. However, most studies have focused on one invasive bee species, while the interactions among two or more species remain poorly understood. Also, many study sites had a history of invasive bees, being hard to find sites with historical low abundances. In Patagonia, Bombus ruderatus (F.) invasion begun in 1993 and B. terrestris (L.) in 2006. Though honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) introduction started in 1859, their density is still low in some parts. By experimentally increasing honey bee densities, we evaluated the effect of honey bees and bumblebees floral visitation on native pollinator floral visitation, pollen deposition, and reproductive success of three plant species in mixed Nothofagus antarctica forests of northern Patagonia: Oxalis valdiviensis, Mutisia spinosa and Cirsium vulgare. Our results show that exotic bees became the main floral visitors. No negative association was found between invasive bee and native pollinator visitation rates, but there was evidence of potential competition between honey bees and bumblebees. Floral neighborhood diversity played an important role in pollinator behavior. Conspecific pollen deposition was high for all species, while deposition of heterospecific pollen was very high in M. spinosa and C. vulgare. Not as expected, honey bees visitation rate had a negative effect on heterospecific pollen deposition in C. vulgare. For O. valdiviensis, exotic visitation rates increased conspecific pollen deposition, which was positively related to reproductive success. Although exotic bees became main floral visitors, their contribution to reproductive success was only clear for one species.},

  Abstract = {The weevil Rhinocyllus conicus Froelich was introduced in Georgia, USA as a biological control agent of musk thistle, Carduus nutans L. (Asteraceae) in 1991. Musk thistle populations and R. conicus infestations were monitored over 10 yr at four sites in central Georgia. Musk thistle populations declined substantially as R. conicus populations increased at all sites, but thistle infestations remained problematic at some sites. A laboratory cage study found that R. conicus would lay eggs on flower buds of yellow thistle, Cirsium horridulum Michaux, bull thistle Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Tenore, and blessed milkthistle, Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner in no-choice and choice tests with and without Ca. nutans. Carduus nutans was preferred over the other thistle species, but the other thistle species were acceptable for oviposition by R. conicus. One or more mixed field infestations of musk thistle and yellow, bull, or blessed milkthistles were sampled for R. conicus infestation. Rhinocyllus conicus was not recovered from capitula of C. vulgare or S. marianum, but R. conicus was found infesting capitula of the native nontarget thistle C. horridulum at multiple field sites from 1997 to 2001. At four sites in 2000 and 2001, R. conicus infestations in C. horridulum averaged 7.47% and 31.19% of flowerheads sampled. This is the first report of R. conicus attacking the nontarget thistle C. horridulum in the field, but the impact that R. conicus may have on C. horridulum populations is not known.},

  Abstract = {Understanding the role of consumers in density-dependent plant population dynamics is a long-standing goal in ecology. However, the generality of herbivory effects across heterogeneous landscapes is poorly understood due to the pervasive influence of context-dependence. We tested effects of native insect herbivory on the population dynamics of an exotic thistle, Cirsium vulgare, in a field experiment replicated across eight sites in eastern Nebraska. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis and density-dependent population models, we found potential for explosive low-density population growth (<U+03BB> > 5) and complex density fluctuations under herbivore exclusion. However, herbivore access drove population decline (<U+03BB> < 1), suppressing complex fluctuations. While plant–herbivore interaction outcomes are famously context-dependent, we demonstrated that herbivores suppress potentially invasive populations throughout our study region, and this qualitative outcome is insensitive to environmental context. Our novel use of Bayesian demographic modelling shows that native insect herbivores consistently prevent hard-to-predict fluctuations of weeds in environments otherwise susceptible to invasion.},

  Abstract = {Allelopathy is a process still little studied in the plant world, if we refer to the diversity of biochemical compounds, through which plants can interact with each other, with fungi or bacteria. Biochemical "dialogue" between organisms may have stimulatory or inhibitory effects, contributing to numerical setting of the populations, the assertion of some species over others, the establishment and strengthen of plant communities. Practically, the allelopathy can be exploited in organic farming in understanding and identifying compatibility between species, to finding natural substances with herbicide potential. In experiments conducted, diluted extracts of Taraxacum officinale and Cirsium vulgare strongly inhibited the germination and growth of corn and beans, while Hedera helix produced the same effect, but at higher concentrations of the extract. Humulus lupulus extract has a stimulating effect on the two species and it is possible to use as natural fertilizer. Extracts of Chenopodium album works as stimulator for Beta vulgaris, and potent inhibitor for Triticum aestivum. Agropyron repens is an aggressive competitor for Lycopersicon esculentum and Capsicum annuum, producing a strong inhibition. Juglans regia extracts and especially those of Satureja hortensis, can be used as natural herbicides for up delay germination and growth suppression for the species: Echinochloa crus-galli and Setaria glauca.},

  Abstract = {Both competitors and natural enemies can limit plant population growth. However, demographic comparisons of the effects of these interactions on introduced versus co-occurring, related native species are uncommon. We asked: (1) does plant competition, insect herbivory, or their combination reduce population growth rate, log <U+03BB>, of the Eurasian thistle Cirsium vulgare sufficiently to explain its limited invasiveness in western tallgrass prairie; and (2) how do the effects of these interactions compare to those for C. altissimum, its co-occurring, synchronously-flowering native congener? We developed integral projection models (IPMs) to estimate log <U+03BB> for both species, using parameter estimates from field experiments. Our models predicted that the growth potential (growth rate at minimal competition and herbivory) for the introduced thistle (log <U+03BB> = 3.5 (2.5, 4.6)) was twice as large as for the native thistle (log <U+03BB> = 1.6 (0.4, 3.1)); however, a high level of competition and ambient insect herbivory together reduced log <U+03BB> to similar values for both thistle species (C. vulgare: log <U+03BB> = -1.3 (-2.4, -0.3) vs C. altissimum: log <U+03BB> = -0.9 (-1.4, -0.3)). This suggests that the introduced thistle was more affected by competition and insect herbivory. For the introduced thistle, neither competition nor insect herbivory alone led to negative log <U+03BB>. In contrast, for the native thistle, high competition alone also led to negative population growth (log <U+03BB> = -0.8, percentile limits do not overlap with zero). Ambient herbivory alone prevented the spread for both thistle species (percentile limits include zero). Overall, the results show that interspecific competition followed by ambient levels of insect herbivory strongly constrained log <U+03BB> for both thistles, limiting C. vulgare invasiveness and C. altissimum abundance. The outcome highlights the importance of synergy between the two biological interactions in limiting plant population growth. Improved understanding of mechanisms limiting log <U+03BB> for weedy plants enhances our ability to predict when biotic resistance will contribute to invasive plant species management.},

  Abstract = {The influence of native fauna on non-native plant population growth, size, and distribution is not well documented. Previous studies have shown that native insects associated with tall thistle (Cirsium altissimum) also feed on the leaves, stems, and flower heads of the Eurasian congener C. vulgare, thus limiting individual plant performance. In this study, we tested the effects of insect herbivores on the population growth rate of C. vulgare. We experimentally initiated invasions by adding seeds at four unoccupied grassland sites in eastern Nebraska, USA, and recorded plant establishment, survival, and reproduction. Cumulative foliage and floral herbivory reduced C. vulgare seedling density, and prevented almost any reproduction by C. vulgare in half the sites. The matrix model we constructed showed that this herbivory resulted in a reduction of the asymptotic population growth rate (<U+03BB>), from an 88 % annual increase to a 54 % annual decline. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that indigenous herbivores limit population invasion of this non-native plant species into otherwise suitable grassland habitat. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  Abstract = {Aims Variations in rates and length of flowering and fruiting not only affect the reproduction of a given plant species but also the behavior and reproduction of associated taxa. Flowering and fruiting variations may be influenced by herbivory, especially by large mammals. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of cattle browsing on the reproductive phenology of understory species in a subalpine post-fire Nothofagus forest in Patagonia. Methods The effects of herbivory on plant reproductive phenology were studied in a set of experimental exclosures (fenced plots) installed since 2001 in a post-fire N. pumilio forest, located in Nahuel Huapi National Park (NHNP), Argentina. We monitored the beginning and duration of each reproductive phenological stage: floral bud, open flower, immature fruit and mature fruit. We also counted the number of flowers, fruits, seeds and viable seeds of the dominant plants to assess whether browsing modifies temporal patterns of the flowering and fruiting periods. Important Findings Cattle reduced the total number of species flowering and fruiting and changed the reproductive phenology of some species. We found that palatable species seem to be negatively affected by browsing in terms of reduced fitness due to changes in flowering and fruiting periods. In contrast, cattle benefitted the reproduction of non-palatable species and could promote the invasion of shade-intolerant exotic forbs such as Cirsium vulgare. The effects of livestock reported in this study are important to understanding how browsing could alter native species establishment and possibly alter successional trajectories during recolonization after fire. © The Author 2013.

  Abstract = {A current challenge in ecology is to better understand the magnitude, variation, and interaction in the factors that limit the invasiveness of exotic species. We conducted a factorial experiment involving herbivore manipulation (insecticide-in-water vs. water-only control) and seven densities of introduced nonnative Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle) seed. The experiment was repeated with two seed cohorts at eight grassland sites uninvaded by C. vulgare in the central Great Plains, USA. Herbivory by native insects significantly reduced thistle seedling density, causing the largest reductions in density at the highest propagule inputs. The magnitude of this herbivore effect varied widely among sites and between cohort years. The combination of herbivory and lower propagule pressure increased the rate at which new C. vulgare populations failed to establish during the initial stages of invasion. This experiment demonstrates that the interaction between biotic resistance by native insects, propagule pressure, and spatiotemporal variation in their effects were crucial to the initial invasion by this Eurasian plant in the western tallgrass prairie. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  Abstract = {The biotic resistance hypothesis is a dominant paradigm for why some introduced species fail to become invasive in novel environments. However, predictions of this hypothesis require further empirical field tests. Here, we focus on evaluating two biotic factors known to severely limit plants, interspecific competition and insect herbivory, as mechanisms of biotic resistance. We experimentally evaluated the independent and combined effects of three levels of competition by tallgrass prairie vegetation and two levels of herbivory by native insects on seedling regeneration, size, and subsequent flowering of the Eurasian Cirsium vulgare, a known invasive species elsewhere, and compared its responses to those of the ecologically similar and co-occurring native congener C. altissimum. Seedling emergence of C. vulgare was greater than that of C. altissimum, and that emergence was reduced by the highest level of interspecific competition. Insect leaf herbivory was also greater on C. vulgare than on C. altissimum at all levels of competition. Herbivory on seedlings dramatically decreased the proportion of C. vulgare producing flower heads at all competition levels, but especially at the high competition level. Competition and herbivory interacted to significantly decrease plant survival and biomass, especially for C. vulgare. Thus, both competition and herbivory limited regeneration of both thistles, but their effects on seedling emergence, survival, size and subsequent reproduction were greater for C. vulgare than for C. altissimum. These results help explain the unexpectedly low abundance recorded for C. vulgare in western tallgrass prairie, and also provide strong support for the biotic resistance hypothesis. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Biomass crops such as short rotation willow coppice (SRC) where Salix cultivars are grown at high density (10 000-40 000 per ha) and each plot harvested on a usually three year rotation may help redress this loss. SRC, certainly in its establishment phase, and, if suitably managed, in early post-harvest rotation, offers significant winter seed resource which within one resource, such as spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare), may change its bird availability depending whether it is upright when used by finches or fallen when utilised by ground feeding thrushes. If this crop becomes widespread in the landscape and it is managed in an environmentally friendly way, it will provide a food resource and possibly habitat " stepping stones" in countryside currently barren of such features. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract = {Previous studies have examined an association between reproductive success and pollination biology of rare versus widespread species through pair-wise comparisons of native and invasive congeners or rare and common congeners. To determine the importance of reproductive success and pollination biology for an invasive thistle, Cirsium vulgare, we compared it in its invaded range to five, co-occurring native Cirsium species that range from rare to common. Native study species include C. fontinale var. fontinale, C. andrewsii, C. brevistylum, C. occidentale, and C. quercetorum. We compared all species' reproductive success, insect visitation rate and composition, autonomous self-pollination, and level of pollen limitation in multiple populations. Species differed in their reproductive success; the invasive C. vulgare produced more flower heads per plant than most native species. C. vulgare attracted more visitors than its congeners. In addition, reproductive success and insect visitation significantly varied between populations within species, mainly due to aphid infestation in one population of C. occidentale. Unlike the rare species (C. fontinale and andrewsii), C. vulgare did not require a pollinator for high-levels of seed production. The remaining native species set fewer seeds than C. vulgare without a pollinator. However, differences in insect visitation and autonomous self-pollination did not lead to differences in pollen limitation across species or between populations. This result suggests that factors other than pollination biology determine the difference in reproductive success of these species. However, high levels of autonomous self-pollination and generalist insect visitation may allow the invasive C. vulgare to easily establish new populations from low numbers of propagules. Our study provides one contrast that should build towards a larger comparative analysis to examine general patterns in the relationship between reproductive success, pollination biology, rare and invasive species, and our ability to predict biological invasions in introduced species. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In 2005 a study was initiated to identify areas of potential nontarget feeding by R. conicus and T. horridus on thistle species by predicting habitats of two known introduced hosts | C. nutans and Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Tenore | and two native species [Cirsium carolinianum (Walter) Fernald and Schubert and C. discolor (Muhlenberg ex Willdenow) Sprengel] using Mahalanobis distance (D 2). Cumulative frequency graphs showed that the D 2 models for all four plant species effectively identified site conditions that contribute to the presence of the respective species. Poisson regression showed an association between D 2 values and plant counts at field-test sites for C. nutans and C. carolinianum. However, negative binomial regression detected no association between D 2 values and plant counts for C. discolor or C. vulgare. Chi-square analysis indicated associations between both weevil species and sites where C. vulgare and Carduus nutans were found, but not between the weevil and native thistle species. Habitats of C. nutans and Cirsium carolinianum overlapped in ˜12% of the study area. Data-based habitat models may provide a powerful tool for land managers and scientists to monitor native plant populations for nontarget feeding by introduced biological control agents. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.},

  Abstract = {Rhinocyllus conicus Fröelich was introduced from Europe into North America as a biological control agent of the exotic weed Carduus nutans L. Concern exists over the feeding of this weevil on at least 25 species of native Cirsium thistles. Beginning in 2008, cage studies isolating adults of R. conicus on buds and flower heads of all eight thistle species (native and introduced) recorded from Tennessee were conducted to test if R. conicus could use these species for reproduction and what impacts larval feeding of R. conicus may have on seed production. Larvae of R. conicus completed development in heads of the native species C. carolinianum (Walter) Fernald and Schubert, and C. horridulum Michaux, and significant reductions in seed numbers of both species occurred during 2008. Rhinocyllus conicus oviposited on both C. carolinianum and C. horridulum at significantly greater levels than the introduced species C. arvense (L.) Scopoli and C. vulgare (Savi) Tenore. Infested heads of C. carolinianum contained numbers of R. conicus per centimeter of plant head width similar to Ca. nutans in 2008, and both native species contained numbers of R. conicus per centimeter of plant head width similar to C. arvense and C. vulgare in 2009. Body length was similar between R. conicus reared on native thistles and its target host Ca. nutans. This report is the first documentation of R. conicus feeding and reproducing on C. carolinianum and C. horridulum. Although R. conicus has been observed only on introduced thistles in naturally occurring populations in this region, the utilization of C. carolinianum and C. horridulum as host species in controlled conditions warrants continued monitoring of field populations and further investigation into factors that may influence nontarget feeding in the future. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.},

  Abstract = {Bumblebees were introduced into New Zealand from the UK approximately 120 years ago and four species became established. Two of these, Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high, probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B. terrestris intermediate between the two. These patterns correspond to the climatic preferences of each species as evidenced by their geographic ranges. Implications for bumblebee conservation in the UK are discussed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  Abstract = {This paper presents early results on the response of six non-native invasive plant species to eight wildfires on six National Forests (NFs) in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Stratified random sampling was used to choose 224 stands based on burn severity, habitat type series, slope steepness, stand height, and stand density. Data for this report are from 219 stands (875 plots) that have repeated measures 1 to 7 years post-fire. Six invasive plant species are abundant enough to analyze for early indications of response to burning. Spotted knapweed occurrence is highest on Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine habitat types on the Bitterroot NF. Canada thistle occurs on most of the sampled wildfires but at low occurrences and percent plot coverage. Bull thistle has rapid increases on the Bitterroot, Flathead, Kootenai, and Malheur NFs, generally with increasing occurrence at higher burn severities, but average percent coverage is low. Orange hawkweed has low occurrences (<5 percent) and never more than 1 percent coverage on a plot. Meadow hawkweed has its highest occurrence on the Bitterroot NF in low burn severities on Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine habitat types. Prickly lettuce is found on most NFs, the highest occurrences being on the Malheur and Panhandle NFs, with increasing occurrence at higher burn severities; however, average percent cover of prickly lettuce is low. Populations of the six species (especially spotted knapweed, bull thistle, and prickly lettuce) need continued monitoring to determine if occurrence and cover continue to change.},

  Abstract = {A comprehensive investigation of the potential of twenty-seven different species of weeds to phytoextract polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from contaminated soil was conducted at two field sites (Etobicoke and Lindsay) in southern Ontario, Canada. Soil concentrations were 31µg/g and 4.7µg/g at each site respectively. All species accumulated PCBs in their root and shoot tissues. Mean shoot concentrations at the two sites ranged from 0.42µg/g for Chenopodium album to 35µg/g for Vicia cracca (dry weight). Bioaccumulation factors (BAF=[PCB]plant tissue/[PCB]mean soil) at the two sites ranged from 0.08 for Cirsium vulgare to 1.1 for V. cracca. Maximum shoot extractions were 420µg for Solidago canadensis at the Etobicoke site, and 120µg for Chrysanthemum leucanthemum at the Lindsay site. When plant density was taken into account with a theoretical density value, seventeen species appeared to be able to extract a similar or greater quantity of PCBs into the shoot tissue than pumpkins (Curcurbita pepo ssp. pepo) which are known PCB accumulators. Therefore, some of these weed species are promising candidates for future phytoremediation studies. © 2010.},

  Abstract = {Both competition and herbivory have been shown to reduce plant survival, growth, and reproduction. Much less is known about whether competition and herbivory interact in determining plant performance, especially for introduced, weedy plant species in the invaded habitat. We simultaneously evaluated both the main and interactive effects of plant neighbors and insect herbivory on rosette growth and seed reproduction in the year of flowering for Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle, spear thistle), an introduced Eurasian species, in tallgrass prairie in 2 years. Effects of insect herbivory were strong and consistent in both years, causing reduced plant growth and seed production, whereas the effects of competition with established vegetation were weak. The amount of herbivore damage inflicted on rosettes did not depend on the presence of neighbor plants. We also found no interaction between competition and herbivory on key parameters of plant growth and fitness. The results of this study contradict the hypothesis that competitive context interacts with insect herbivory in limiting the invasiveness of this introduced thistle. Further, the results provide additional, experimental evidence that high levels of herbivory on established rosettes by native insects exert significant biotic resistance to the invasiveness of C. vulgare in western tallgrass prairie. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

  Abstract = {Endemic plant species are often thought to be restricted to marginal habitats as a result of a trade-off between fitness in high-stress environments and competitive ability in benign environments. Here we provide a unique test of this hypothesis by manipulating competition and habitat quality across a gradient and contrasting closely related species that differ in their habitat specializations. We compared the competitive abilities of five Cirsium species that co-occur in northern California and range from an endemic species to a noxious invader. The endemic species Cirsium fontinale var. fontinale is restricted to low-nutrient serpentine habitats. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to compare the competitive abilities of all native species with those of conspecifics (intraspecific competition) and with those of the invasive species Cirsium vulgare (interspecific competition) under five nutrient treatments.We hypothesized that C. fontinale would have a poor competitive ability in a highnutrient environment compared with its congeners due to a stress-competition trade-off. In contrast to our expectations, however, we found that C. fontinale competed well, even in high-nutrient environments. It was the only native species that showed no significant difference in biomass between intraspecific- and interspecificcompetition treatments. Its inability to expand its range beyond the serpentine habitat is likely explained by factors other than poor competitive abilities in less stressful environments. Understanding the mechanisms that explain why endemic species are restricted to harsh abiotic environments requires removing them from their specialized habitats and comparing their fitnesses and competitive abilities in more benign environments. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.},

  Abstract = {Postrelease studies can provide data with which to evaluate expectations based on prerelease tests of biological control insects. In 2004, we observed Trichosirocalus horridus Panzer (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the rosette weevil introduced into North America against Eurasian thistles, feeding on native tall thistle, Cirsium altissimum L. Spreng., in tallgrass prairie. In this study, we examined the rosette weevil's use of tall thistle, compared with its use of the co-occurring exotic bull thistle, C. vulgare (Savi) Tenore. For both thistle species, we quantified weevil frequency, abundance, and seasonal variation in incidence, using both timed observations at two sites over two growing seasons (2004, 2005) and dissections of thistle flowering shoots from 13 sites (2005). Based on prerelease information, we expected the Eurasian thistle to be the quantitatively preferred host plant for this Eurasian weevil. Instead, we found that both the frequency of infestation and the mean number of adult rosette weevils per plant were at least as high, and sometimes higher, on the native thistle as on the exotic thistle. Furthermore, adult weevil phenology coincided on the two host species. This study provides new quantitative evidence of nontarget feeding by another weevil released for thistle biological control; and it raises important questions for further research. We conclude that continued new releases, as well as augmentation of existing populations, of T. horridus should wait until more research is done on the impact of the nontarget occurrence now reported for this biological control insect. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.},

  Abstract = {1. Parameter uncertainty challenges the use of matrix models because it violates key assumptions underlying elasticity analyses. We have developed a matrix model to compare Monte Carlo methods with elasticity analyses for estimation of the relative importance of factors in the asymptotic population growth rate, <U+03BB>, of Cirsium vulgare (spear thistle) in Nebraska, USA. 2. We calculated <U+03BB> for a base model using 11 parameter estimates available for Nebraska populations plus eight extracted from the literature, causing parameter uncertainty. We then calculated <U+03BB> for 10 000 alternative models using Monte Carlo parameter estimation; parameters were drawn from the full range of each parameter in the literature and partial rank correlation analysis (PRCC) was used to order the parameters by the magnitude of their effect on <U+03BB>. 3. Monte Carlo analysis found that insect floral herbivory, affecting the regeneration transition, was the most important parameter affecting <U+03BB>, whereas elasticity analyses suggested that the transition from small to medium size was the most significant. Statistical comparison, using PRCC vs. lower level elasticity (LLE), showed that the Monte Carlo analysis provided a more accurate assessment. 4. As <U+03BB> > 1 in 99% of the model runs even with significant floral herbivory, we added two parameters influenced by weed management (probability of large thistles dying without producing seed and proportion of seeds that failed to germinate). Simulations that included reductions in these parameters, along with floral herbivory, led to <U+03BB> < 1 in 17% of the runs, suggesting these three factors interact to produce the low densities observed for this invasive thistle in our study area. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the utility of the Monte Carlo approach for modelling weed dynamics with parameter uncertainty and multiple, potentially interacting, parameters. Invasive population growth by C. vulgare could be limited by a combination of weed management practices and the biotic resistance imposed by native floral herbivores. © 2007 The Authors.},

  Abstract = {Buffer strips are refuges for a variety of plants providing resources, such as pollen, nectar and seeds, for higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, mammals and birds. Margins can also harbour plant species that are potentially injurious to the adjacent arable crop (undesirable species). Sowing perennial species in non-cropped buffer strips can reduce weed incidence, but limits the abundance of annuals with the potential to support wider biodiversity (desirable species). We investigated the responses of unsown plant species present in buffer strips established with three different seed mixes managed annually with three contrasting management regimes (cutting, sward scarification and selective graminicide). Sward scarification had the strongest influence on the unsown desirable (e.g. Sonchus spp.) and unsown pernicious (e.g. Elytrigia repens) species, and was generally associated with higher cover values of these species. However, abundances of several desirable weed species, in particular Poa annua, were not promoted by scarification. The treatments of cutting and graminicide tended to have negative impacts on the unsown species, except for Cirsium vulgare, which increased with graminicide application. Differences in unsown species cover between seed mixes were minimal, although the grass-only mix was more susceptible to establishment by C. vulgare and Galium aparine than the two grass and forb mixes. Annual scarification can enable desirable annuals and sown perennials to co-exist, however, this practice can also promote pernicious species, and so is unlikely to be widely adopted as a management tool in its current form. © 2008 The Authors.},

  Abstract = {Climate and disturbance are considered key factors in explaining plant invasion, mainly by their effect on alien seedling recruitment. We tested whether soil disturbance by digging and altitude, as a sub-set of climate, affected the seedling recruitment of two alien species (Cirsium vulgare and Melilotus alba) in the mountain grasslands of central Argentina. We performed a seed-addition factorial experiment with altitude as a fixed factor co-variable (6 levels), time since sowing (6 levels) as an autoregressive co-variable, and soil disturbance by digging (two levels) and seed addition (two levels) as fixed factors. Seeds of the studied species were sown in replicated undisturbed and disturbed soil plots, in grassland stands located every 200 m from 1200 to 2200 m a.s.l. The number of emerging seedlings at each plot was recorded during a period of 8 months, at intervals of 30-60 days. Seedlings of both alien species emerged at all the studied altitudes, but only the recruitment of C. vulgare increased linearly with altitude. Moreover, the time window of seedling recruitment for this species increased with altitude. Soil disturbance produced a significant decrease in overall seedling emergence of both species; however, an increase in emergence was observed for C. vulgare at an altitude over 2000 m a.s.l. Natural emergence inside control plots without seed addition was only observed for Cirsium vulgare, which indicates that this species was not seed limited. Our results show that altitude and the absence of disturbance do not restrict the recruitment of C. vulgare and M. alba in these natural mountain grasslands. Moreover, these alien species seem to be tolerant to and even favoured by conditions occurring at higher altitudes and in absence of micro-site soil disturbances in the Córdoba mountain grasslands. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

  Abstract = {The identification of less competitive weed species and infestation rates might allow weeding operations to be better targeted, help conserve local plant biodiversity, and facilitate reductions in the amount of herbicide used to achieve woodland regeneration. Therefore, the effect of competition from pure stands of Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten., Epilobium ciliatum Raf., Holcus lanatus L., Poa annua L., and Persicaria maculosa Gray on Betula pendula Roth was investigated over 2 years. All weed species reduced tree growth significantly compared with weed-free plots, but there were no significant differences among species. When Lolium perenne L., Rumex obtusifolius L., and Cirsium vulgare were established at four densities in plots containing newly planted B. pendula over a 1-year period, all weed species reduced tree growth, but Lolium perenne was the most competitive. Weed density had no significant effect, indicating that even sparse weed growth can have a major impact on tree performance. None of the treatments affected B. pendula survival. These results confirm the inhibitory effects of a range of weed species on tree growth, but not survival, and the capacity of B. pendula to recover in the second year after planting from an initial check in growth. Percent cover was a good explanatory variable for models developed to describe the effects of weeds on tree growth, and preliminary competition indices for the different species are presented. © 2006 NRC.},

  Abstract = {Weeds germinating from seed are serious competitors for resources with young trees and can delay or prevent woodland establishment and regeneration. However, there is only limited information available on which pre-emergence herbicides are effective on problem weeds that commonly occur in these situations, in particular for perennial species germinating on fertile ex agricultural sites. Following previously reported glasshouse screening experiments for potentially useful herbicide treatments, ten residual herbicide treatments were tested on twelve problem weed species in the field. The results showed considerable variations in the susceptibilities of weed species to the different herbicide treatments. The combination of atrazine plus cyanazine, included as a standard herbicide mix that is commonly used in forestry situations, was the most effective treatment overall, with most weed species appearing to be susceptible or moderately susceptible. Chamerion angustifolium (rosebay willowherb) was the most sensitive species tested, being well controlled by the mixture of atrazine plus cyanazine, metazachlor, the higher doses of napropamide, and the mixture of metazachlor plus pendimethalin. Cirsium arvense (creeping thistle) was susceptible to isoxaben, and atrazine plus cyanazine. Clematis vitalba (old man's beard) was susceptible to isoxaben. Senecio vulgaris (groundsel) was well controlled by atrazine plus cyanazine, and metazachlor. Ranunculus repens (creeping buttercup) only appeared to be controlled by napropamide. Rumex obtusifolius (broadleaved dock) and Urtica dioica (common nettle) were susceptible to pendimethalin. Rubus fruticosus agg. (bramble), Cirsium vulgare (spear thistle), Senecio jacobea (common ragwort) and Trifolium repens (white clover) were only susceptible to the mixture of atrazine plus cyanazine. Brassica napus ssp. oleifera (volunteer oilseed rape) was not completely controlled by any of the treatments, although atrazine plus cyanazine did give significant growth reductions. A comparison of the susceptibility implied by existing literature, glasshouse pot experiments and the field trials reported here, shows the importance of confirming results obtained in pot trials with field testing and provides valuable information on efficacy which will be useful in assisting herbicide selection in the future. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {Understanding the grazing conditions under which plant populations are limited by seed availability (seed limitation) is important for devising management schemes that aim to manipulate the establishment of weed and forage species. Seeds of three weed species (Cirsium arvense, C. vulgare and Rumex obtusifolius) and five forage species (Lolium perenne, Lotus uliginosus syn. L. pedunculatus, Paspalum dilatatum, Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium repens) were broadcast sown into L. perenne-T. repens pastures in Manawatu, New Zealand and five sheep-grazing and two slug-grazing (with and without molluscicide) treatments were imposed in a split-plot design. Of the five sheep-grazing treatments, four compared continuous grazing with rotational grazing at intervals of 12, 24 and 36 d in spring, with all four grazed under a common rotation for the remainder of the year. The fifth treatment was continuous grazing all year. Seed sowing increased seedling emergence of C. vulgare, L. perenne, P. lanceolata, R. obtusifolius and T. repens under all sheep- and slug-grazing treatments, with differences in seedling densities persisting for at least 21 months. Seed sowing did not increase seedling densities of C. arvense, L. uliginosus or P. dilatatum. The effects of sheep-grazing management on seedling emergence and survival were uncoupled. For the five seed-limited species, seedling emergence was greater on pastures that were rotationally grazed during spring compared with those that were continuously grazed. However, seedling survival was lower in pastures grazed rotationally during summer, autumn and winter, so that after 21 months seedling numbers were greater on plots that were continuously grazed all year. Exclusion of slugs increased seedling recruitment of T. repens but had no impact on the other species. As weed and forage species responded in a similar way to sheep-grazing management (increased under continuous, decreased under rotational), it is unlikely that the goals of reducing weed invasions and enhancing forage species establishment could be carried out concurrently in established pastures with the same management. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract = {Any plant not sown from seed is often labeled a weed in improved pastures of New Zealand. Most improved pastures are a mix of perennial ryegrass and white clover but generally are infested with broadleaf weeds. Changes in forage production due to individual weeds were determined using measurements of perennial ryegrass and white clover before and after dairy cattle, beef cattle, or sheep grazing under, near, and far from individual plants of six rosette-forming weed species throughout a growing season. The larger weeds, bull thistle and musk thistle, reduced the amount of forage utilized 42 and 72%, respectively, in beef cattle- and sheep-grazed hill-country pastures. Forage production under and near Canada thistle, hedge mustard, broadleaf plantain, and hairy buttercup in a dairy pasture was greater (136, 140, 178, and 450%, respectively) than in the control areas. Although the dairy pasture was grazed following recommended grazing procedures, our results indicate that this grazing system was not maximizing forage yield potentials of perennial ryegrass and white clover and that these weeds served as an indicator that the pasture was being overgrazed.},

  Abstract = {Question: What are the effects of fire on the structure and the diversity of a Spartina argentinensis tall grassland in the short and medium run. S. argentinensis is the dominant species of tall grasslands on inland marshes of the Chaco-Pampean region (Argentina), where spontaneous or man-made fires are very frequent. Location: Federico Wildermuth Reserve (31°57' S; 61°23' W), Province of Santa Fe, Argentina, an area never ploughed that supported cattle until its exclusion in 1988. Methods: Vegetation was surveyed in randomly placed permanent plots using the Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance scale. The data were analysed by multivariate methods (PCA and MRPP) for synthesizing information and testing hypotheses. Results: Fire did not have a long-lasting effect on the tall grassland. There was only a temporarily reduction of cover-abundance of S. argentinensis which allowed an increase in the number of accompanying species such as Heliotropium curassavicum, Pluchea sagittalis, and Verbena litoralis and of some naturalised or weed species, such as Melilotus alba and Cirsium vulgare, respectively. Fire increased diversity, which remained relatively high for two to three years. Three years after the fire there were no significant differences on the amount of litter accumulated on burned and unburned plots. Conclusion: Fire should be considered an intrinsic part of the dynamics of S. argentinensis tall grassland. © IAVS; Opulus Press.},

  Abstract = {Weeds growing from seed can cause severe problems in forest nurseries and in woodland establishment by competing for resources with the young trees, leading to reduced growth and survival. Herbicides approved for use on new plantings of farm forestry and forest nurseries were usually developed originally for use in agricultural crops. As a result, information on the susceptibility of weeds that may be a problem in forestry situations rather than the rotational cropping systems used in agriculture is limited. In this series of glasshouse experiments the efficacy of residual and foliar-acting herbicides primarily used on agricultural crops was tested on 14 species of weeds. Cardamine hirsuta, Epilobium ciliatum, Poa annua, Senecio vulgaris, and Spergula arvensis were all effectively controlled by diphenamid, lenacil, metamitron, metazachlor and napropamide when applied immediately after sowing. These species were also controlled when sown into soil sprayed 1 month earlier, indicating persistent phytotoxicity of the herbicides. Cirsium vulgare, E. ciliatum, Senecio jacobaea, Trifolium repens and Urtica dioica grown from seed were well controlled by low dose pre-emergence applications of atrazine, clopyralid+cyanazine, metazachlor and simazine. Ranunculus repens was effectively controlled by pendimethalin and propyzamide. Cyanazine applied early post-emergence also controlled all these species, but their susceptibility to other herbicides varied. Pre-emergence control of the perennial weed species Agrostis stolonifera, Rubus fruticosus and Rumex obtusifolius grown from seed was given by low doses of atrazine, clopyralid+cyanazine, metazachlor and propyzamide. Isoxaben, napropamide and pendimethalin were effective on A. stolonifera and R. obtusifolius. Early post-emergence applications of atrazine and cyanazine controlled all these species; other herbicides varied in efficacy. E. ciliatum, R. repens, S. jacobaea and U. dioica as small seedlings were well controlled by recommended doses of amidosulfuron, pyridate and tribenuron-methyl. T. repens was generally unaffected even at the earliest growth stage. The doses of residual herbicides required for weed control were relatively low, indicating the greater susceptibility of weeds grown in containers compared with field conditions, probably due to restricted rooting depth. The results provide guidance on which herbicides may be worth testing in field conditions for the control of these problem weeds, however diphenamid is no longer commercially available and cyanazine is currently not being supported by the EC Pesticide Review Programme. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here the effects on aphid acceptance of barley after exposure to volatiles and root exudates from two common weeds, the thistles Cirsium arvense and Cirsium vulgare, were investigated. 2. Settling by bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, was significantly reduced on barley plants that had been exposed to volatiles from Cirsium species for 5 days. Settling by Sitobion avenue was also reduced on Cirsium-exposed plants, whereas settling by Metopolophium dirhodum was not. 3. In olfactometer tests, Cirsium-exposed barley was significantly less attractive to R. padi than was unexposed barley, indicating that exposure causes a change in the volatile profile of barley. 4. Exposure of barley to root exudates from Cirsium species had no effect on R. padi settling. 5. The results lend weight to the theory that the effects of plant-plant allelopathy can extend to higher trophic levels.},

  Abstract = {Questions: Can seed addition enhance the success of establishing species-rich grassland on former arable land? Are sowing date and cutting regime important in determining success? Location: Aberdeen and Elgin, northeast Scotland, United Kingdom. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at two sites to assess the effect of seed addition, sowing date and cutting regime on the vegetation developing on former arable land, the aim being to compare the success of different treatments at producing a species-rich grassland. Results: Sowing a seed mix resulted in the establishment of vegetation very distinct from the species-poor vegetation dominated by perennial grasses which otherwise developed, though establishment success of the sown grassland species was highly variable between sites. Where establishment of the sown species was poor, sowing date had no significant effect on species composition, whereas the cutting regime was very important. Cutting the vegetation significantly increased both the number and abundance of sown species compared with the uncut control. Conversely, where establishment had been good, the cutting regime in the first year had little effect on species composition. Cutting the vegetation at least twice a year appeared to be the most effective management over the length of the experiment. Conclusions: Sowing a seed mixture significantly reduced the abundance and number of naturally colonising species, effectively controlling problem weed species such as Senecio jacobaea and Cirsium vulgare, highlighting the agronomic value of sowing seed mixtures on fallow farmland. The sowing of a seed mix on former arable land has demonstrated that it is feasible to create vegetation similar in character to that of species-rich grasslands.},

  Abstract = {Field experiments were carried out at the Facultad de Agronomía, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina (34°25'S, 58°25'W), to evaluate the possibility of reducing weed seedling emergence through the use of alfalfa cultivars with low levels of winter dormancy and by increasing plant density from 200 to 400 plants m-2. It was hypothesized that these treatments would alter the temperature regime and the red (R)-far-red (FR) ratio of radiation to which seeds were exposed. Responses to management treatments were recorded for bull thistle, cotton thistle, plumeless thistle, tall rocket, mustard, curly dock, and pigweed. During the alfalfa establishment year, pigweed and curly dock emergence was reduced by the nondormant cultivar established at high density. This reduction disappeared when soil beneath the canopy was fitted with heaters that mimicked bare-soil temperatures. Crop canopy presence during the establishment year was not effective in reducing mustard, cotton thistle, bull thistle, plumeless thistle, and tall rocket emergence. During the second and third years after crop establishment, the canopy of the nondormant alfalfa cultivar was effective in reducing germination of weed seeds placed on the soil surface during fall and winter. In contrast, the winter-dormant cultivar allowed the establishment of weeds during the winter period. These reductions in weed emergence were associated with a modification in the R-FR ratio perceived by the seeds located at the soil surface and could largely be removed by using FR filters to increase the R-FR ratio. These results suggest that the selection of a nondormant cultivar combined with an increase in plant density could effectively reduce weed populations in alfalfa.},

  Abstract = {Rhinocyllus conicus is a flower-feeding weevil that has played a pivotal role in the biological control of several thistle species around the world. More recently it has achieved notoriety because of the damage it causes on several species of native thistles in North America. From 1984 to 1986, R. conicus was released for biological control of spear thistle, Cirsium vulgare, in three different regions of South Africa. Although the weevils have been established in the country since then, no proper surveys have been made to determine the extent of damage they are causing on C. vulgare. To redress the situation, samples of flower-heads from several localities were examined and damage due to R. conicus was recorded. The study showed that R. conicus has not dispersed more than 2.5 and 3.9 km from two of the original release sites where establishment was confirmed. The weevil is seldom particularly abundant (levels of damaged flower-heads exceeded 65% at only two of 17 weevil-inhabited sites). Flower-heads set earlier in the season suffered higher levels of damage by the weevils, and infected flower-heads had significantly fewer seeds compared to uninfected flower-heads. All indications are that the contribution by R. conicus to biological control of C. vulgare in South Africa has been meagre due to unidentified constraints, at least in the two localized areas that the weevils currently occupy. Manual redistribution is required to determine whether or not other regions might be more suitable for R. conicus.},

  Abstract = {Winter and spring burnings constitute a traditional management practice of the Flooding Pampa grasslands which are dominated by the tussock grass Paspalum quadrifarium. In addition to increasing the primary productivity and the nutrient quality of the regrowth, this burning favours the establishment of opportunistic species, especially the legume Lotus glaber and the thistles Cirsium vulgare and Carduus acanthoides. The aims of the present study were to assess the effects of burning and those of the remnant litter on L. glaber and thistle recruitment, as well as the effects of L. glaber density on the emergence, survival and flowering of thistles. Two field experiments were carried out: 1. A completely randomized factorial design with occurrence of L. glaber and fire was applied in a mature Paspalum stand; 2. A completely randomized design with four L. glaber seed densities oversown on a burned Paspalum stand, as the treatments. Thistle and L. glaber recruitment within the Paspalum stand was dependent on fire, but their emergence in burnt plots was reduced by the presence of remnant litter. Remnant litter and interference from L. glaber provide complementary mechanisms to reduce fire-cued colonization by thistles. While seedling emergence of thistles was mostly affected by the presence of remnant litter, seedling survival depended on local density of L. glaber. By the end of the first post-fire growing season, the survivorship of established thistles was linearly reduced with increasing sowing density and above-ground biomass of L. glaber. The maintenance of a significant litter coverage and a high density of L. glaber in the pre-fire seed bank, as well as the oversowing of L. glaber after fire, may be useful tools in fire management of Paspalum stands aimed to improve their forage value with reduced dependence on chemical control of weeds.},

In recent years, we have confirmed feeding and oviposition by E. pustulosa, and some degree of larval development of this beetle, on a naturalized congeneric thistle, Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Tenore. In this study, we assessed the host suitability of C. vulgare for E. pustulosa, using larval rearing and simple food choice tests, by comparing the performance on, and preference for, their legitimate host C. kamtschaticum. All experiments were initiated in July, when the utilization of C. vulgare by E. pustulosa became obvious. For larval performance, E. pustulosa showed a lower eclosion rate, shorter developmental duration and smaller body size when reared on C. vulgare than on C. kamtschaticum. Cirsium vulgare appeared to be a less adequate larval food than C. kamtschaticum. Adult feeding preference was altered seasonally; females preferred C. kamtschaticum to C. vulgare in a food choice test conducted in early July, whereas they showed the opposite preference in tests conducted in mid and late July. The utilization of C. vulgare by E. pustulosa appeared to be induced by qualitative deterioration of C. kamtschaticum leaves in July, which resulted in increased dispersion of adult beetles.},

  Abstract = {Extensive areas in the mountain grasslands of central Argentina are heavily invaded by alien species from Europe. A decrease in biodiversity and a loss of palatable species is also observed. The invasibility of the tall-grass mountain grassland community was investigated in an experiment of factorial design. Six alien species which are widely distributed in the region were sown in plots where soil disturbance, above-ground biomass removal by cutting and burning were used as treatments. Alien species did not establish in undisturbed plots. All three types of disturbances increased the number and cover of alien species; the effects of soil disturbance and biomass removal was cumulative. Cirsium vulgare and Oenothera erythrosepala were the most efficient alien colonizers. In conditions where disturbances did not continue the cover of aliens started to decrease in the second year, by the end of the third season, only a few adults were established. Consequently, disturbances are needed to maintain alien populations in tall-grass mountain grasslands. Burning also increased the species richness of native species. We conclude that an efficient way to control the distribution of alien species is to decrease grazing pressure while burning as a traditional management tool may be continued.},

  Abstract = {Root-infecting nematodes are common on white clover (Trifolium repens) in dairy pastures on the north coast of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland, Australia, where they are thought to contribute to poor growth and persistence. The nematode responsible for causing root-knot symptoms on white clover was identified as Meloidogyne trifoliophila, a species not previously recorded from Australia. M. trifoliophila failed to reproduce on any of the standard North Carolina hosts used to identify M. javanica. M. hapla, M. arenaria and M. incognita, but caused severe galling and exhibited a high rate of reproduction on white clover. PCR primers for these Meloidogyne species also failed to amplify DNA of M. trifoliophila. Identity was confirmed by morphological measurements and plant symptoms. In a glasshouse test, increasing initial nematode density within the range 0 to 10 000 per 500 ml pot led to reduced shoot and root growth, fewer nodules and more severe root-knot symptoms. A second pot test screened weed species as potential alternative hosts of M. trifoliophila. None of the eight grass species was galled but M. trifoliophila reproduced on two of the eight dicotyledon weeds, spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare) and pigweed (Portulaca oleraceae).},

Aiming to compare the relative impact of L. tenuis on pre and post-emergence stages of C. vulgare, the emergence, survivorship and coverage of C. vulgare were evaluated in response to four sowing densities of L. tenuis (0.0; 0.25; 0.5 and 1.0 seeds/cm2) and two spatial patterns of C. vulgare (15 uniformly distributed seeds within a circle of 5 cm diameter or on a circle of 28 cm diameter), by using a factorial design under greenhouse conditions. The emergence of C. vulgare lineally declined with increasing densities of L. tenuis, independently of its spatial pattern of sowing. While the emergence of C. vulgare was reduced up to 40% by the presence of L. tenuis, the effects of this species on the seedling mortality of the emerged seedlings reached up to 270% of increment. In contrast with the emergence, which was mostly affected by the maximum densities of L. tenuis, the final coverage of C. vulgare was similarly reduced for the presence of L. tenuis irrespective of its density. These results confirm the occurrence of pre-emergent effects of L. tenuis seeds on C. vulgare seeds, as previously detected under laboratory conditions, even under potentially adverse conditions for the activity of allelopathic compounds.},

  Abstract = {Cultural history and cropping systems create an environmental heterogeneity that determines variability in both crop yield and weed communities. Describing relationships between environmental heterogeneity, crop yield, and weed communities may be useful for making agricultural management decisions. We studied the weed communities of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields in the Rolling Pampa, Argentina, to identify floristic and functional (life cycles, origin, and morphotypes) structure in fields with different management practices, and to explore the association between weed species, cultural history, and crop yield. We surveyed 18 and 42 different fields in 1994 and 1995, respectively, in soybean cropped with conventional and no-tillage practices. In 1994, we recorded presence of weed species and in 1995 we recorded weed presence and abundance, and management information (type of tillage, number of agricultural cycles, grain yield, planting date, and weed control). We used multivariate analysis to examine relationships among variables. We distinguished four communities and eight floristic groups, related to crop yield and tillage system. The presence of Floristic Groups II [Oxalis chrysantha (Kunth) Prog., Sonchus oleraceus L., and Veronica persica Pair.], VII [Carduus acanthoides L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Physalis viscosa L., Taraxacum officinale Weber, and Coronapus didymus (L.) Sm. I, and IV [Bidens subalternans DC., Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten., and Cyperus sp. L.] may be an indicator of high potential crop yield (low soil degradation), and their absence may be an indicator of low potential crop yield (increasing soil degradation). Functional structure (life cycles, origin, and morphotypes) was similar between communities, indicating that agroecosystems preserve function, despite management practices. The main variables explaining weed distribution in the surveyed region were tillage system, crop yield, planting date, and the number of agricultural cycles.},

  Abstract = {The influence of sown herb strips on larval stages of aphidophagous syrphids was studied in different strips and adjacent winter wheat fields near Berne (Switzerland) from 1993 to 1995. The aim of this study was to learn whether these sown herb strips offer a supply of aphids sufficient enough to sustain the first generation of syrphids in spring or a further generation after crop harvest. Aphid infestation of the strips occurred at about the same time as in winter wheat, between the end of May and the beginning of August. A first syrphid generation in spring can therefore not develop on weeds in strips. Furthermore, after harvest no further generations will appear in strips. The highest numbers of syrphid pre-imaginal stages in 1993 and 1994 were found on spontaneously growing weeds (Rumex obtusifolius, Cirsium arvense and C. vulgare). Among the sown species, Centaurea jacea and Pastinaca sativa showed the highest syrphid larvae densities. The densities in herb strips (max. 0.6 larvae/m2) were manyfold lower than in wheat (10 pupae/m2). In herb strips the same syrphid species as in winter wheat were identified. In both habitats Episyrphus balteatus was the most abundant species. Epistrophe spp. were only found in strips. No dependence of oviposition within wheat fields on the distance to the strips could be demonstrated. Due to their great mobility, it is easy for adult syrphids to find aphid colonies within a crop field. The strips are neither significant for an early development of the first syrphid generation nor for an additional generation after wheat harvest. The importance of herb strips for hoverflies lies in their quality to supply them with pollen and nectar, which increases the fitness of the adults.},

  Abstract = {To colonize newly disturbed areas, weedy species must disperse their seeds in space and/or in time. Cirsium vulgare has poor dispersal in space, but can form a persistent seed bank. Fresh seeds are capable of germinating in either light/dark or constant dark conditions under favourable diurnal temperatures of 25°C : 10°C. Despite this lack of dormancy, a large proportion of seeds do not germinate in the autumn after dispersal. Variation in germination requirements according to seed colour was also examined. Fresh seeds were placed under one of two overwintering treatments at 5°C, alternating light/dark or constant darkness. Some seeds of all colours: white, light, intermediate, dark and black germinated under these conditions. Six months later, ungerminated seeds subjected to the light/dark treatment did not require light for germination when placed under optimal temperatures. However, most seeds that had overwintered in constant darkness required light for germination. In the field, this induced dormancy would prevent seeds from germinating if buried or located in deep shade. Such seeds have the potential of forming a persistent seed bank. The proportion of dormant seeds did not appear to be associated with seed colour. Seeds incubated at 10°C following overwintering under light/dark conditions germinated to a higher percentage than seeds overwintered in darkness, regardless of the light conditions for germination. The results of this study help to explain the contradiction between delayed germination in the field and the lack of seed dormancy.},

  Abstract = {The distribution, density and cover of small-scale natural disturbances was surveyed in semi-natural and set-aside vegetation in a hilly landscape in Central Germany in the spring of 1995. More of the landscape was disturbed on set-aside agricultural land in valleys (1.02%) and on warm south-facing slopes (1.33%) than on rocky hilltops (0.3%) and cool north lacing slopes (0.56%). The major agents of disturbance on set-aside fields were moles, rodents (and their predators) and wild boars. In surrounding semi-natural grasslands, rabbit warrens were common on south-facing slopes and mound-building ants on north-facing shapes. Disturbances were significantly clustered and frequently superimposed. In order to investigate the effects of disturbance quality on plant assemblages in set-aside fields, two common types of disturbances were compared. These were grazing lawns (0.4 1.0 m2) maintained throughout the summer by common voles (Microtus arvalis), and excavations, 0.7-1.6 m2 in area, where wild boars (Sus scrofa) grubbing for food had removed vegetation and top soil in early spring. Both types of disturbances increased plant species richness on the local scale. Wind-dispersed annual and pauciennial forbs of ruderal habitats (e.g. Carduus acanthoides, Cirsium vulgare, Matricaria maritima, Senecio vernalis) were most abundant on the superficial disturbances made by voles, whereas small, ephemeral field weeds (e.g. Polygomun aviculare, Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, Fallopian convolvulus) predominated on patches grubbed by boars. This study confirms that small-scale disturbances by animals provide a variety of regeneration niches for field weeds and ruderals. The rate of decline in plant species richness on set-aside land is likely to be reduced where land is utilized by a variety of herbivorous and soil-moving mammals.},

  Abstract = {Abstract Seedling emergence of three weeds (Carduus nutans, Cirsium vulgare and Rumex obtusifolius) and three clovers (Trifolium repens, T. subterraneum and T. pratense) was monitored in gaps of different sizes (0, 2, 6 and 10 cm diameter, plus a 3 m2 bare plot), which were created in a Loliumperenne/T. repens pasture. Clover emergence was greatest in the bare plots, in contrast with the weeds, whose emergence peaked in small or intermediate-sized gaps. Relationships between weed emergence and gap size in glasshouse swards were poorly denned. As a result of trampling by cattle, seedling mortality occurred most rapidly for all species in the bare plots. Very few weeds survived in the other gaps, where there was no detectable effect of gap size upon survivorship. Naturally occurring gaps were most abundant during summer, but their size frequency distributions varied little between spring and autumn. The sizes of almost 95% of the natural gaps were within the range of the experimentally-created gaps. Poor survivorship of weeds within this range, however, suggests that larger gaps are required for regeneration. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  Abstract = {Eighteen herbicides or herbicide tankmixes were evaluated over 3 years (1987-89) for their control of 11 important summer-growing weeds on fallows in southern New South Wales and the Wimmera area of Victoria. Each of the weeds was effectively controlled by at least 1 herbicide. The tank-mixes of glyphosate plus metsulfuron (270 + 4.2 g a.i./ha) and glyphosate plus 2, 4-D ester (270 + 320 g a.i./ha) were the most effective treatments, each giving an average of 68% control of all species. Hogweed (Polygolzunz avicu1ar.e L.), prickly paddy melon (Cucumis myriocarpris Naudin), spear thistle [Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten.] and skeleton weed (Chondrilla juncea L.) were the species most tolerant of these 2 tank-mixes. When these species were exluded, glyphosate plus metsulfuron and glyphosate plus 2, 4-D ester gave an average of 90 and 88% control, respectively, of the remaining species [common heliotrope, Heliotropiunz europaeum L.; camel melon, Citrullus larzatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai var. lanatus; prickly lettuce, Lactuca serriola L.; sowthistle, Sonchus spp.; clammy goosefoot, Chenopodium pumilio R.Br.; caltrop, Tribulus terrestris L.; stink grass, Eragrostis ciliatiensis (All.) E. Mosher]. Hogweed was most effectively controlled by 2, 4-D amine plus dicamba (750 + 100 g a.i./ha) or 2, 4-D ester (800 g a.i./ha); prickly paddy melon by 2, 4-D amine plus triclopyr (750 + 96 g a.i./ha); spear thistle by 2, 4-D amine plus dicamba (750 + 100 g a.i./ha) or glyphosate plus clopyralid (270 + 60 g a.i./ha); and skeleton weed by 2, 4-D amine plus clopyralid (750 + 60 g a.i./ha). A pot experiment confirmed field observations that, as common heliotrope ages, glyphosate and glyphosate plus metsulfuron become less effective for its control. © 1990 ASEG.},

  Abstract = {Achenes of Cirsium vulgare germinated at constant temperatures between 7°C and 32°C. Fresh achenes had a higher optimum temperature of germination (23.5°C) than older achenes which had been stored for 10 months (20°C). Fresh achenes also germinated more slowly and had a lower maximum level of germination. Achenes that were buried in the soil showed a decrease in viability over time. At depths of 2 cm achenes either germinated or were destroyed. At greater depths the achenes showed an exponential decay rate in viability with time. The slope of this exponential curve decreased with increasing depth of burial. Germination in the field was synchronous with rainfall pattern over the summer, although subsequent germination may occur if achenes are brought to the surface. Young seedlings were not damaged by frosts of -2°C. After germination a major root system developed rapidly, whilst a rosette more slowly formed above ground. Rosettes increased in diameter until the winter when growth ceased, although horizontal growth was reinitiated if the rosette became damaged. In late winter or early spring vertical growth is initiated, leading to the formation of a bushy plant with subsequent flowering and production of achenes. C. vulgare flowers throughout the spring and summer with the maximum number of plants flowering in the late spring or early summer. Each capitulum holds approximately 200 achenes and a large plant may produce in excess of 50,000 fertile achenes. Apart from fertile achenes, “shrunken” and “hollow” achenes are also produced by non-pollination and self-pollination respectively. After the capitulum has matured the achenes are wind dispersed. However, despite the presence of a pappus the majority of achenes fall within a circle of radius 1.5 times the height of the parent plant. In conjunction with the production of non-viable achenes through self-fertilisation, this is expected to result in marginal spread of this species from existing infestations. achenes are also produced by non-pollination and self-pollination respectively.

Twenty-seven species of insect, 3 mites, 3 molluscs and 3 fungi were found attacking the plants to varying degrees. Apart from the fungi, these organisms were polyphagous and a large proportion were introduced species themselves. A notable gap in resource use was the virtual absence of endophages, particularly those attacking the capitula or roots of thistles. This contrasts markedly with the structure of the thistle fauna in their native European ranges, which is rich in species utilising these feeding niches. The prospects of finding effective biological control agents from these groups of insects therefore seems quite promising. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  Abstract = {Seeds of seven introduced thistle species, common and widespread in southern Australia, were germi-nated over a range of different day!night temperatures and water potentials. The thistles were Carduus nutans L. (nodding), C. pycnocephalus L. and C. tenuiflorus Curtis (slender), Carthamus lanatus L. (saffron), Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. (spear), Onopordum aff. illyricum (illyrian) and Silybum marianum J. Gaertn. (variegated). Fresh seed of all thistle species germinated over a wide temperature range (15/5° to 40/30°C). Differences between taxa were expressed mainly at low temperatures (15/5° and 15/0°C), at which C. pycnocephalus germinated well and Onopordum only minimally. Germination of C. lanatus seeds was the most sensitive to moisture stress and that of C. nutans and C. vulgare the least. Radicle elongation of germinating seedlings differed at different water potentials, with C. tenuiflorus being the most sensitive to low water potential and that of C. lanatus the least, even at a water potential of - 1.5 MPa. The seven thistle species were separated into three groups based on the patterns of their phenological responses over two seasons when grown in a common environment. Carduus pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus behaved as short-season annuals, C. vulgare and Onopordum showed a strongly biennial response, and the other species were annual except for C. nutans, which behaved as an annual or a biennial depending on time of establishment. We conclude that the differences in germination responses to temperature and water potential between the different introduced thistles are minor. In combination with the major differences in phenology revealed in this study some of these differences may help to explain the predominance of the seven thistles in different regions of southern Australia. Other factors will largely determine their weediness in any one region. © 1989, CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {The “transient” and “persistent” components of the soil seed bank beneath a kauri forest remnant are described. The methodology employed separates recent seed rain (collected in trays over a two year period) from dormant viable seed with longevity >2 years (soil beneath trays). A total of 46 vascular plant species, and 908 individuals, were recorded from tray and sub-tray samples. Species composition of trays and sub-trays varies markedly. Trays are dominated by four woody, native species; Kunzea ericoides, Coprosma arborea, Myrsine australis, and Carpodetus serraius. Sub-tray samples show an accumulation of seeds from light-demanding weedy species, including many adventives such as Solatium mauritianum, Phytolacca octandra, and Cirsium vulgare. In addition, seeds of two woody, native species, Cordyline australis and Geniostoma rupestre, are abundant. Detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA) shows clear differences between floristic composition of trays and sub-trays and, further, between on-site vegetation and components of the soil seed bank. These differences are explained in terms of seed longevity, seed accumulation rates, suitability of site conditions for growth of individual species, and the role of seed dispersal agents, especially birds. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Six (35%) of the 17 insect species feeding on bull thistle as well as native species of Cirsium are stenophagous (i.e., apparently restricted to host plants in the subtribe Carduinae). All six identified species reported from yellow-spine thistle also occur on native Cirsium thistles in southern California, including three endophages and two oligophages (i.e., apparently restricted to the genus Cirsium). Faunal characteristics suggest that yellow-spine thistle is related more closely to Cirsium thistles native to southern California than to bull thistle.},

  Abstract = {Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. is a serious biennial alien weed only in pasture land in Australia. To identify reasons for such preferential infestation and to isolate sensitive stages in the life history of C. vulgare, comparative demographic analyses were conducted in grazed, ungrazed and herbicide-treated Mediterranean-like pastures in south-eastern Australia. Grazing by sheep (i) reduced competition from neighbouring plants, (ii) increased C. vulgare growth, flowering and seed (achene) production, and (iii) promoted survival of C. vulgare seedlings. The most sensitive period in the life of C. vulgare appears to be the transition from the seedling to rosette life stages where, for example, an average survival rate of only 0.2 and 1.0% occurred in ungrazed and grazed pastures, respectively. In contrast, 10 and 15% of seeds successfully emerge on average as seedlings, and 49 and 51% of rosettes successfully develop into adult plants. Control of C. vulgare with dicamba was most effective just after initiation of autumn rainfall. This time corresponds to the period of naturally high seedling mortality in C. vulgare induced by competition from neighbouring plants. Démographie de Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. et sa maîtrise par rapport au pâturage Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. est une mauvaise herbe bisannuelle en Australie, d'origine étrangère, mais elle n'est importante que dans les pâtures. Dans le but de déterminer les raisons de cette préférence et d'établier les stades sensibles dans le cycle de C. vulgare, des analyses démographiques ont été entreprises au sud-est de l'Australie dans des pâtures de type méditerranéen. Le pâturage des moutons a diminué la concurrence des plantes voisines, rendu plus importantes la croissance de C. vulgare ainsi que sa floraison et la production de graines (akènes) et favorisé la survie des jeunes plants adventices. Il parait que le stade le plus sensible de la vie de C. vulgare est la période de transition du stade jeune plant au stade rosette, où le taux moyen de survie était de 0,2% sans et 1% avec pâturage. Par contre, une levée de 10 et 15% des graines a été constatée et 49 et 51% des rosettes deviennent des plantes adultes. Le dicamba s'est montré le plus efficace contre C. vulgare en application juste après le commencement des pluies d'automne, époque d'une forte mortalité naturelle parmi les jeunes plants, provoquée par la concurrence des plantes voisines. Populationsdynamik und Bekämpfung von Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. unter Bezug auf Beweidung Cirsium vulgare tritt in Australien nur in Weideland als wichtiges, zweijähriges, adventives Unkraut auf. Um Ursachen für die selektive Besiedelung von Grasland und um empfindliche Entwicklungsstadien im Entwicklungszyklus herauszufinden, wurden in SO-Australien vergleichende populationsdynamische Untersuchungen in beweidetem, unbeweidetem und mit Herbiziden behandeltem Grasland von mediterranem Typus durchgeführt. Die Beweidung durch Schafe hatte zur Folge, dass (i) die Konkurrenz durh benachbarte Pflanzen verringert, (ii) das Wachstum, Blühen und die Samenproduktion von C. vulgare gesteigert und (iii) die Ueberlebensrate von C. vulgare-Sämlingen erhöht wurden. Es scheint, dass im Entwicklungszyklus von C. vulgare der Uebergang vom Sämlings-zum Rosettenstadium die empfindlichste Phase darstellt, in der nur 0,2% in unbeweidetem. resp.1% in beweidetem Grasland überleben. Die Keimungsrate hingegen beträgt im Mittel 10 und 15% und 49 und 51% der Jungpflanzen im Rosettenstadium entwickeln sich zu adulten Exemplaren. Die Bekämpfung von C. vulgare mit Dicamba erwies sieh kurz nach Beginn der herbstlichen Regenfälle als am wirksamsten. Dieser Zeitpunkt entspricht einer Periode erhöhter, natürlicher Keimlingsmortalität, bedingt durch eine verstärkte Konkurrenzierung durch benachbarte Pflanzen. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

  Abstract = {The biology of Urophora cardui (L.) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and its suitability as a biocontrol agent for Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) were investigated. The incubation period of the eggs was 4.3 days at 27°C. Crowding did not significantly reduce the longevity of the adults, the number of eggs laid, or the egg hatch. U. cardui overwinters as a mature larva in the gall but pupation and further development ensue when the larvae are exposed to air by opening the gall. The roots of single and double-galled plants weighed 65 and 78% less and the combined weights of the stem and leaves 47 and 58% less respectively than plants without galls. U. cardui is monophagous: it oviposits into Canada thistle and if kept without this host, into the closely related weeds Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten. and Carduus acanthoides L. U. cardui is a promising biological control agent and should be released in Canada. Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) is a widespread noxious weed in Canada and the northern United States. This paper reports on the biology of Urophora cardui (L.), a European tephritid, and its suitability for introduction into Canada to aid in the control of the thistle. © 1975, Entomological Society of Canada.

  Abstract = {Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) is a broadleaf weed that can severely damage soybean fields. Two C. album populations (1744 and 1731) suspected resistant to imazethapyr were investigated for resistance levels to imazethapyr, thifensulfuron-methyl, and fomesafen and their resistance mechanisms were investigated. Whole-plant dose-response assays revealed that, compared to the susceptible (S) population, the 1744 population was 16.5-fold resistant to imazethapyr, slightly resistant to thifensulfuron-methyl (resistance index [R/S], <3). The 1731 population was 18.8-fold resistant to imazethapyr, 2.9-fold resistant to thifensulfuron-methyl, and 5.1-fold resistant to fomesafen. In vitro acetolactate synthase (ALS) assays showed 17.1-fold and 19.3-fold resistance levels of 1744 and 1731 populations to imazethapyr respectively. ALS gene sequence analysis identified Ala122Thr amino acid substitution in the 1744 population and Ser653Thr amino acid substitution in the 1731 population. No mutations of the protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) gene were detected. However, pre-treatment with malathion reversed fomesafen resistance, suggesting nontarget-site resistance mechanisms likely play a role in the 1731 population.},

  Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the minimum doses of the imazamox active ingredient (ai) that provide satisfactory efficacy (>90%) against fat hen (Chenopodium album L.) and common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.). These two weeds are among the most troublesome weeds of bean fields. The minimum dose studies were carried out separately in the 2–4 and 6–8 true leaf stages of both weeds. The experiments were carried out in pots under greenhouse conditions. The experiments were repeated three times. In the first two experiments, the recommended dose of imazamox (100%) together with 75%, 50% and 25% doses were applied to the weeds during the above-mentioned leaf stages. Some pots were left untreated for control. In the third experiments, 12.50% and 6.25% of the recommended doses were also tested. Plant height and the number of leaves were recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days following the herbicide application. As a result of the studies, it was determined that nearly half the recommended dose (48.18 g ai/da) provides 90% success in the control of common cocklebur (X. strumarium L.) when applied at the 2–4 true leaf stages, while a lower dose (36.11 g ai/da) is required for obtaining the same control when applied at the 6–8 true leaf stages. For the fat hen (C. album L.), only a 17.69 g ai/da application dose was found to provide 90% control at the period of 2–4 true leaves, while 21.21 g ai/da was noted to provide 90% control when applied at the 6–8 true leaf stage. The results suggest that the increase in leaf area reduces the imazamox requirement for the control of X. strumarium.},

  Abstract = {Carfentrazone-ethyl is embedded in guar gum to prepare a polymer-herbicide conjugate gel formulation for a sustained release of the active ingredient (a.i.). The sprayable gel formulation was optimized at 0.5% (w/v) concentration. Strong interactions of the prepared composition of the polymer-herbicide conjugate system are shown through spectroscopic techniques, depicting the peak broadening of hydrophilic -OH bonds in the herbicide at 1743 cm-1, shifting to 1730 cm-1in the polymer-herbicide sample. There is a broadening and shifting of the peak at 329 nm for the n <U+2192> p* transition at 335 nm in the polymer-herbicide conjugate system in UV spectra. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements show a lowering of endothermic melting peaks to 242 and 303 °C in the polymer-herbicide conjugate. X-ray diffraction studies showed a sharp diffraction peak of the pure polymer at a 2<U+03B8> of ~20.3°, while broadening and shifting of the peak position to a 2<U+03B8> of ~20.8° were observed after adding the herbicide. Diffusion of the active ingredient in the polymer-herbicide conjugate resulted in much greater coverage (most of the weed leaf stomata (>95%)) than conventional spraying. The efficacy of both the polymer-herbicide formulation and herbicide at different doses in weed nurseries showed significantly higher weed mortality in Anagallis arvensis (95.4%), Chenopodium album (~97%), and Ageratum conyzoides (93.16%) treated with the polymer-herbicide formulation @ 20 g a.i. ha-1. Narrow SPAD readings range of A. arvensis (0.1-30.6) and that of C. album (0-5) were observed in the polymer-herbicide formulation @ 20 g a.i. ha-1was at par with the conventional formulation @ 30 g a.i. ha-1. Less regeneration in a weed nursery of A. arvensis (27%), C. album (77%), and A. conyzoides (49%) treated with gel formulations @ 20 g a.i. ha-1was observed, which was significantly lower than those in conventional herbicides.},

  Abstract = {This experiment was conducted to study the effects of mesotrione on the control efficiency and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of Chenopodium album. Simulating three rainfall intensities of 2 mm/h (light rain), 6 mm/h (moderate rain) and 10 mm/h (heavy rain) at different interval times (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h) to analyze variable regulation of the control effect, the photosynthetic pigment content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of C. album after spraying mesotrione. With the extension of rainfall time interval, the inhibition rate of plant height, plant control effect and fresh weight control effect of C. album were gradually increased, the inhibition effect of rainfall on the efficacy was gradually decreased, at the same time, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, the maximum photochemical quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), the actual photochemical quantum yield (Y (II)) and quantum yield (Y (NO)) production of regular energy consumption of C. album were also increased, while the nonregulatory energy decreased gradually. The results showed that the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in leaves of C. album increased significantly by 35.63% and 35.38% compared with the control under the condition of simulating 6 mm/h in interval 1 hour. The study suggested that simulating 10 mm/h rainfall intensity had the greatest effect on C. album, the photosynthetic pigment content, Fv/Fm and Y (II) of leaves were significantly higher than those in the control groups under 0.5 h, 1 h and 2 h interval treatments. The carotenoid content was the lowest and Y (NO) was the largest under the 4 h interval treatment. As is displayed that rainfall reduced the weed control effect in the aspect of controlling C. album on mesotrione, which is partly contributed to increase photosynthetic pigment content and enhance the PS II photochemical activity. In conclusion, the rain intensity of =2 mm/h did not affect the control effect of mesotrione on C. album. At 6 mm/h within 1 h after treatment, the control effect of fresh weight was significantly reduced by more than 7.14%, and at 10 mm/h within 2 h, the control effect was significantly reduced by more than 14.78%.},

Novosibirskaya 15. The study was conducted in Central Siberia (in the environs of the city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia) from May to August 2020. The biological efficacy of the embedded TBM was 92.3%, which was considerably higher than the biological efficacy of the Mortira formulation used as the post-emergence spray (15.4%). The embedding of TBM into degradable blended matrix enabled long-duration functioning of this unstable herbicide in soil. The sensitivity of weed plants to TBM differed depending on the species. TBM was more effective against A. retroflexus and A. blitoides, which were killed at an earlier stage, than against C. album and G. aparine, whose percentage increased in the earlier stage and which were controlled by the herbicide less effectively and at later stages. On the plot treated with the embedded herbicide, the parameters of the wheat yield structure were the best, and the total yield was the highest: 3360 ± 40 kg/ha versus 3250 ± 50 kg/ha in the group of plants sprayed with the Mortira formulation. The grain produced in all groups was of high quality and was classified as Grade 1 food grain. The highest quality parameters (grain hectoliter mass, gluten, and protein contents) were obtained in the group of plants treated with the embedded herbicide. The study of the embedded TBM confirmed the high efficacy of the experimental formulation.},

  Abstract = {Water stress and weed competition are critical stressors during corn (Zea mays L.) development. Genetic improvements in corn have resulted in hybrids with greater tolerance to abiotic and biotic stressors; however, drought stress remains problematic. Therefore, with the expected change in precipitation throughout the Great Lakes Region, greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate water stress and weed competition on drought tolerant corn performance. The study followed a completely randomized block design with four replications. Factorial treatment combinations consisted of drought tolerant corn competition (presence or absence), water stress (100 or 50% volumetric water content (VWC)), and nine corn:common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) (CHEAL) densities. Corn and C. album growth parameters were measured 14 and 21 days after water stress initiation. To address the impact of reduced soil moisture and weed competition on corn and C. album growth parameters, photosynthetic response, and biomass; linear mixed effects and non-linear regression models were constructed in R. Chenopodium album biomass was reduced by 46 and 50% under corn competition at two and four weeds pot-1 (p = 0.0003, 0.0004). However, introducing crop competition under six and nine weeds pot-1 did not reduce C. album biomass (p = 0.90, 1.00). Averaged across weed pressures, corn biomass was 22% less when grown under 50% compared to 100% VWC (p = 0.0003). However, averaged across VWC, increasing weed competition from zero to two (p = 0.04), four (p = <0.0001), six (p = 0.0002), or nine (p = 0.0002) weeds pot-1 reduced biomass by 22, 38, 35, and 36%. Overall, water stress and C. album competition negatively affected the parameters measured in this study; however, the magnitude of reduction is stronger under drought stress than increasing weed competition when water is not limiting. Therefore, field crop growers must modify current integrated weed management programs to maintain yield under future climate stress.},

  Abstract = {Many studies have documented the interaction between 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-inhibiting and photosystem II (PSII)-inhibiting herbicides. Most studies have focused on the interaction between mesotrione and atrazine, with few studies characterizing the nature of the interaction between tolpyralate and atrazine. Therefore, five field experiments were conducted in Ontario, Canada over a three-year period (2019-2021) to characterize the interaction between three rates of tolpyralate (15, 30, and 45 g ai ha-1) and three rates of atrazine (140, 280, and 560 g ai ha-1) for the control of seven annual weed species in corn (Zea mays L.). Tolpyralate at 30 or 45 g ai ha-1 applied with atrazine at 280 or 560 g ai ha-1 controlled velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), C. album (Chenopodium album L.), and wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.) >90% at 8 weeks after application (WAA). Tolpyralate and atrazine were synergistic at each rate combination for the control of A. theophrasti at 8 WAA. In contrast, A. retroflexus and S. arvensis control were additive with each rate combination at 8 WAA. At 8 WAA, C. album control was generally additive, but one rate combination was synergistic. Ambrosia artemisiifolia control at 8 WAA was synergistic with five rate combinations and additive with the other four. Barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] control at 8 WAA was additive with seven of the rate combinations and synergistic with two of the rate combinations. Setaria spp. control at 8 WAA was synergistic with one more rate combination compared to E. crus-galli, but the two weed species shared the same synergistic rate combinations. This study concludes that extrapolation or broad classifications of the interaction between tolpyralate and atrazine would be inappropriate as the interaction can vary due to herbicide rate, weed species, and the response parameter analyzed.},

  Abstract = {The complementary modes of action of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-and photosystem II (PSII)-inhibitors have been credited for the synergistic weed control improvement of several species. Recent research discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent lipid peroxidation is the cause of cell death by the glutamine synthetase-inhibitor glufosinate. Therefore, a basis for synergy exists between glufosinate and HPPD-inhibitors, but the interaction has not been well reported. Four field experiments were conducted in Ontario, Canada in 2020 and 2021 to determine the interaction between HPPD-inhibiting (mesotrione and tolpyralate) and ROS-generating (atrazine, bromoxynil, bentazon, and glufosinate) herbicides on annual weed species control in corn (Zea mays L.). The ROS-generators were synergistic with the HPPD-inhibitors and provided =95% control of velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), except for tolpyralate + glufosinate which was additive 8 weeks after application (WAA) and control was 87%. Tank-mixes of HPPD-inhibitors plus ROS-generators were synergistic for the control of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) except for tolpyralate + glufosinate which was antagonistic 8 WAA. Tolpyralate + glufosinate was antagonistic for the control of barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] and Setaria spp. 8 WAA. Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) control 8 WAA was synergistic and =95% with mesotrione plus atrazine, bromoxynil, or glufosinate and with tolpyralate plus bromoxynil or bentazon. Herbicide tank-mixes were generally additive for the control of wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.) 8 WAA except for the synergistic tank-mixes of tolpyralate plus atrazine or bromoxynil; however, each tank-mix provided 97-100% control of S. arvensis. Results from this study demonstrate that co-Application of ROS-generators with mesotrione or tolpyralate controlled all broadleaf weed species >90% at 8 WAA with the exceptions of A. artemisiifolia and C. album control with tolpyralate + glufosinate. Mesotrione plus PSII-inhibitors controlled E. crus-galli and Setaria spp. 48-68 percentage points less than tolpyralate plus the respective PSII-inhibitor at 8 WAA; however, mesotrione + glufosinate and tolpyralate + glufosinate controlled the grass weed species similarly.},

  Abstract = {Climate-smart agriculture (CSA)-based management practices are getting popular across South-Asia as an alternative to the conventional system for particular weed suppression, resources conservation and environmental quality. An 8-year study (2012–2013 to 2019–2020) was conducted to understand the shift in weed density and diversity under different CSA-based management practices called scenarios (Sc). These Sc involved: Sc1, conventional tillage (CT)-based rice–wheat system with flood irrigation (farmers’ practice); Sc2, CT-rice, zero tillage (ZT)-wheat–mungbean with flood irrigation (partial CA-based); Sc3, ZT rice–wheat–mungbean with flood irrigation (partial CSA-based rice); Sc4, ZT maize–wheat–mungbean with flood irrigation (partial CSA-based maize); Sc5, ZT rice–wheat–mungbean with subsurface drip irrigation (full CSA-based rice); and Sc6, ZT maize–wheat–mungbean with subsurface drip irrigation (full CSA-based maize). The most abundant weed species were P. minor > A. arvensis > M. indicus > C. album and were favored by farmers’ practice. However, CSA-based management practices suppressed these species and favored S. nigrum and R. dentatus and the effect of CSAPs was more evident in the long-term. Maximum total weed density was observed for Sc1, while minimum value was recorded under full CSA-based maize systems, where seven weed-species vanished, and P. minor density declined to 0.33 instead of 25.93 plant m-2 after 8-years of continuous cultivation. Full CSA-based maize–wheat system could be a promising alternative for the conveniently managed rice–wheat system in weed suppression in north-west India.},

  Abstract = {Alternative strategies to control weeds are required at the field level to reduce herbicides and derived pollution. As cover crop, rye (Secale cereale L.) is adopted mainly because of its allelopathic weed control, which takes place through a strong inhibition of germination and seedling growth in several types of grass and broad-leaved weeds. The present study consisted of: I) a field trial, focused on the evaluation of biomass production and allelochemical concentration in the biomass, and in situ weed control at 30 days after termination (with two termination timings: T1 - heading phase and T2 - 10 days later) of 8 rye varieties; ii) a pot experiment, focused on the inhibition effect of mulches derived by those 8 rye varieties on four summer weeds: Velvetleaf (Abutilon t weed biomass, compared with the control, is highly correlated with the allelochemical content in rye biomass in the case of T1 termination, while with the biomass production in the case of T2. In pots, a strong inhibitory effect on seedling growth due to rye mulching was observed for C. album (-76%), A. retroflexus (-56%), and P. olearcea (-84%), while not for A. theophrasti. We concluded that, regardless of the variety, adopting rye as a cover crop may be considered as a suitable practice to reduce weed pressure at the field level. Among all the varieties tested, Forestal and Protector showed the most significant weed suppression potential, due to the high amount of allelochemicals production for Forestal and high biomass production for Protector.},

This study aimes to evaluate the effect of metribuzin, halosulfuron and flumioxazin applied individually and as mixtures (metribuzin:halosulfuron and metribuzin:flumioxazin) on Chenopodium album, Amaranthus retroflexus, and potatoes on biomass and chlorophyll-a fluorescence in 21 experiments. The individual herbicide experimental design was a randomized completely block design with seven doses and three replications. The factorial experiments were performed on the basis of randomized completely block design in three replications for binary mixture exper-iments. Flumioxazin was very potent in controlling C. album, A. retroflexus, and injured potatoes with a 50% effective dose (ED50 ) of 1.21, 0.54, and 12.23 g ai·ha-1, respectively. Both mixtures of metribuzin:halosulfuron and metribuzin:flumioxazin generally showed an antagonistic effect on both weeds and potato in 12 independent experiments. Metribuzin, halosulfuron, and flumioxazin significantly decreased photosystem II activity by decreasing the maximum quantum efficiency (Fv /Fm ). The metribuzin:halosulfuron mixtures almost followed the Additive Dose Model for Fv /Fm, whilst there was an antagonistic effect for the metribuzin:flumioxazin that was closely related to biomass. The results indicated that mixtures were generally antagonistic, and the endpoint choice is pivotal when assessing the joint action of mixtures.},

  Abstract = {Allergic rhinitis and asthma are highly related to indoor and outdoor allergens. A common weed, Chenopodium album is one of these outdoor aero-allergens. In the literature, data about specific characteristics of children with C. Album sensitization is limited. In this study, we aimed to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with Chenopodium album sensitization in a cross-sectional study. The patients and two control groups included in the study were found to be sensitized to Chenopodium album following skin prick tests in an allergy clinic over a period of one year. The patients and control groups completed a questionnaire consisting of items regarding demographics and clinical characteristics. The frequency of Chenopodium album sensitizationwas 9.4% (47/502). The distribution of these patients diagnoses was: 48.9% allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC), 19.1% allergic rhinitis (AR), 12.8% ARC + asthma, 8.5% asthma, 4.3% asthma + AR. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was statistically higher than in the control groups (P: 0.008, P: 0.001). Allergic rhinitis symptoms and ocular symptoms occurred together in 51% during the pollination period of Chenopodium album, whereas 17% of the patients were asymptomatic between August-September. Forty percent of the patients had accompanying sensitization to animal dander (cat and/or dog dander), which was statistically high compared to control group 1 (P: 0.001). In conclusion, Chenopodium album sensitization is highly related to rhinoconjunctivitis. Children with ocular symptoms must be evaluated for Chenopodium album sensitization. These children can also be expected to have a high animal dander sensitization rate.},

  Abstract = {Whether facilitation from native plants is strong enough to trigger community dominance by non-natives remains unclear. We explored the possibility that facilitation from Prosopis caldenia, the dominant native tree in the semiarid open forest of central Argentina, drives local community dominance by Chenopodium album, an annual herb native to Europe. We assessed this hypothesis by conducting extensive field sampling in which we recorded the relative abundance of species growing under the canopy of P. caldenia (caldén microsites) and in adjacent locations free of this tree (open microsites). If our hypothesis is correct, then the relative abundance of C. album will be greater than that of the rest of the species only when growing under P. caldenia. Also, we measured C. album performance, estimated its soil seed bank, and characterized growing conditions in caldén and open microsites. We found that the relative abundance of C. album was over seven times greater than that of any other species in communities occurring in caldén microsites; by contrast, C. album co-dominated communities with several other species in the open. Chenopodium album density, cover, biomass, and fecundity were all several times greater in caldén than open microsites. Similarly, C. album seed bank displayed an eight-fold increase in caldén as compared to open microsites. Growing conditions were markedly different between microsites, which could explain positive responses from C. album. Our results suggest that facilitation from natives is indeed strong enough to trigger local community dominance by non-natives, advancing the understanding of community-level consequences of this interaction.},

  Abstract = {Weeds account for losses in crop yields, and this event might be exacerbated by salinity. Therefore, we investigated the responses of Chenopodium album L. and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) to salt stress, as well as interferences between species. Ten-day old plants were grown for 1 week in a single-or mixed-species set-up, either with or without 100 mM of NaCl. C. album reduced the biomass of soybean similarly to salt stress, while its growth was unaffected under any condition. C. album decreased the crop protein content when salinity was applied. This effect was ascribed to altered protein metabolism and/or N usage to produce other N metabolites, including osmolytes. The two species did not reciprocally affect the capacity to accumulate Na+, but the weed contained two-fold more Na+ in the leaves. Elevated initial K+ concentration and high K+ delivery to the shoot likely explained the better acclimation of C. album to salinity. C. album produced more phenolics and proline and exhibited greater antioxidant activity, but low lipid peroxidation, in the mixed set-up under salinity. Thus, it is possible that the weed could become more resilient to salinity when growing in a soybean field. In the long term, this might cause significant losses in soybean productivity as expected by the dramatic decline in crop protein content.},

  Abstract = {(1) Background: Weed control decreases the competition for nutrients, but also the potential of increased phosphorus (P) mobilization in soils caused by higher plant diversity. (2) Methods: Impacts of weed species under maize on mycorrhizal colonization and plant-availability of P were investigated in two pot experiments. Plant traits and P mobilization were tested in weed-free maize and in mixed growth with six annual weed species. (3) Results: Growth of maize decreased in treatments with weeds, while P concentrations in its shoots increased in mixed growth with C. album, E. crus-galli and P. convolvulus. Mycorrhizal colonization of maize without weeds was low (<20% of root length), but increased in mixed growth with C. album, E. crus-galli and V. arvensis up to 40%. The activities of Pmobilizing hydrolytic enzymes (phosphatases, ß-glucosidase) and plant-availability of P were occasionally higher under mixed growth with weeds. The dimension of weed impacts on P cycling under maize differed significantly between both experiments. (4) Conclusions: Weeds potentially promote P mobilization and mycorrhizal colonization under maize, but this impact is not guaranteed. The weed-based improved P supply of maize should be defined under field conditions to allow a controlled weed tolerance in maize cropping systems.},

  Abstract = {Greenhouse studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter content and soil pH on initial and residual weed control with flumioxazin by planting selected weed species in various lab-made and field soils. Initial control was determined by planting weed seeds into various lab-made and field soils treated with flumioxazin (71 g ha-1 ). Seeds of Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyard grass), Setaria faberi (giant foxtail), Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed), and Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) were incorporated into the top 1.3 cm of each soil at a density of 100 seeds per pot, respectively. Emerged plants were counted and removed in both treated and non-treated pots two weeks after planting and each following week for six weeks. Flumioxazin control was evaluated by calculating percent emergence of weeds in treated soils compared to the emergence of weeds in non-treated soils. Clay content was not found to affect initial flumioxazin control of any tested weed species. Control of A. theophrasti, E. crus-galli, and S. faberi was reduced as soil organic matter content increased. The control of A. retroflexus was not affected by organic matter. Soil pH below 6 reduced flumioxazin control of A. theophrasti, and S. faberi but did not affect the control of A. retroflexus and E. crus-galli. Flumioxazin residual control was determined by planting selected weed species in various lab-made and field soils 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after treatment. Eight weeks after treatment, flumioxazin gave 0% control of A. theophrasti and S. faberi in all soils tested. Control of A. retroflexus and Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters) was 100% for the duration of the experiment, except when soil organic matter content was greater than 3% or the soil pH 7. Eight weeks after treatment, 0% control was only observed for common A. retroflexus and C. album in organic soil (soil organic matter > 80%) or when soil pH was above 7. Control of A. theophrasti and S. faberi decreased as soil organic matter content and soil pH increased. Similar results were observed when comparing lab-made soils to field soils; however, differences in control were observed between lab-made organic matter soils and field organic matter soils. Results indicate that flumioxazin can provide control ranging from 75–100% for two to six weeks on common weed species.},

  Abstract = {This paper describes the antigerminant capacity of water extracts of silver fir needles created by means of hydrodynamic cavitation processes. Fir needles (2 kg fresh weight) collected in the winter were blended and crushed in ice, poured in water only (120 L) and processed in a controlled hydrodynamic cavitation device based on a fixed Venturi-shaped reactor. The A. alba water extract (AWE), comprising an oil-in-water emulsion of silver fir needles’ essential oil (100% AWE), was diluted in distilled water to 75% and 50% AWE, and all aqueous solutions were tested as antigerminant against four weeds and four horticultural species and compared to control (distilled water). This study shows the effective inhibitory effect of pure AWE on germination, which mainly contains limonene (15.99 ng/mL) and a-pinene (11.87 ng/mL). Seeds showed delayed germination and inhibition but also a reduction in radicle elongation in AWE treatments as compared to control. This combined effect was particularly evident in three weeds (C. canadensis, C. album and A. retro-fllexus) while horticultural species showed mainly effects on the radicle elongation as found in L. sativa, P. crispum and S. lycospermum, which showed on average 58%, 32% and 28%, respectively, shorter radicles than in the control. P. sativum was not affected by AWE, thus raising the hypothesis that seed characteristics and nutrition reserve might play a role in the resistance to terpenes inhibitory effect.},

  Abstract = {Proherbicides increase the utilization efficiency of herbicides by reducing their off-site movement and premature degradation. Mesotrione is a prevalent herbicide used to control weeds in maize crops, but it is susceptible to degradation and leaching in soil. We report the synthesis of hydrolytically reversible conjugates of mesotrione and detail the unique reactivity of its ß-triketone moiety. Three proherbicides were created through phenyl thioether, ethyl thioether, or phenyl ester linkages to mesotrione. The derivatives demonstrated controlled release of mesotrione in aqueous conditions with nearly quantitative release in acidic pH within 24 days for both thioether derivatives and 100 min for the phenyl ester derivative. Moreover, all three conjugates reduced the mobility of mesotrione in acidic soil. Specifically, both thioethers demonstrated nominal mobility and release of mesotrione in soil. For the phenyl ester derivative, after approximately 100 mL of water leached, only 40% mesotrione was released from the soil column, compared to 80% observed in the free herbicide control. Finally, the phenyl ester conjugate exhibited improved pre-emergent herbicidal activity against a common weed, Chenopodium album, at a low application concentration of 50 g AI ha-1. At 50 g AI ha-1, the proherbicide demonstrated 31.4 ± 12.1% efficacy against C. album while free mesotrione controlled only 10.0 ± 5.3%. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential to increase mesotrione's utilization efficiency by creating proherbicide derivatives.},

  Abstract = {Effective weed management depends on correct control timing, which depends on seedling emergence dynamics. Since soil temperature and soil moisture are the two main factors that determine weed germination, the hydrothermal time model can be used to predict their emergence. The aim of this study was to estimate the base temperature (Tb) and base water potential (<U+03A8>b) for the germination of Chenopodium album, Amaranthus retroflexus, Setaria pumila, and Panicum capillare collected from fields in continental Croatia and then to compare these values with those of Italian populations embedded in the AlertInf model. Germination tests were performed at seven constant temperatures (ranging from 4 to 27<U+25E6> C) and eight water potentials (0.00–1.00 MPa). The estimated Tb and <U+03A8>b were 3.4<U+25E6> C and -1.38 MPa for C. album, 13.9<U+25E6> C and -0.36 MPa for A. retroflexus, 6.6<U+25E6> C and -0.71 MPa for S. pumila, and 11.0<U+25E6> C and -0.87 MPa for P. capillare, respectively. According to the criterion of overlap of the 95% confidence intervals, only the Tb of C. album and the <U+03A8>b of A. retroflexus of the Croatian and Italian populations were similar. Further field experiments should be conducted to monitor the weed emergence patterns of C. album and calibrate the AlerInf equation parameters.},

  Abstract = {Amaranthus retroflexus L. and Chenopodium album L. are noxious weeds that have a cosmopolitan distribution. These species successfully invade and are adapted to a wide variety of diverse climates. In this paper, we evaluated the morphology and biochemistry of 16 populations of A. retroflexus L. and 17 populations of C. album L. Seeds from populations collected from Spain, France, and Iran were grown together at the experimental field of the agriculture research of University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, and a suite of morphological traits and biochemical traits were assessed. Among the populations of A. retroflexus L. and of C. album L. were observed significant differences for all the measured traits. The number of branches (BN) for A. retroflexus L. (12.22) and inflorescence length (FL; 14.34) for C. album L. were the two characteristics that exhibited the maximum coefficient of variation. Principal component analysis of these data identified four principal components for each species that explained 83.54 (A. retroflexus L.) and 88.98 (C. album L.) of the total variation. A dendrogram based on unweighted neighbor-joining method clustered all the A. retroflexus L. and C. album L. into two main clusters and four sub-clusters. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to evaluate relationships between climate classification of origin and traits. Similarly, the measured characteristics did not group along Köppen climate classification. Both analyses support the conclusion that A. retroflexus L. and C. album L. exhibit high levels of diversity despite similar environmental histories. Both species also exhibit a high diversity of the measured biochemical compounds indicating that they exhibit different metabolic profiles even when grown concurrently and sympatrically. Several of the biochemical constituents identified in our study could serve as effective indices for indirect selection of stresses resistance/tolerance of A. retroflexus L. and C. album L. The diversity of the morphological and biochemical traits observed among these populations illustrates how the unique selection pressures faced by each population can alter the biology of these plants. This understanding provides new insights to how these invasive plant species successfully colonize diverse ecosystems and suggests methods for their management under novel and changing environmental conditions.},

  Abstract = {The widely adapted Eurasian summer annuals Chenopodium album and Chenopodium murale are opportunistic colonizers of disturbed areas that have spread globally via human vectors and long-term association of humans with agriculture. Chenopodium album is predominantly a weed of temperate zones, whereas C. murale is more prevalent at subtropical latitudes. Both species reduce yields by interference across a wide range of crops, with C. album consistently ranked among the top five worst weeds in North America. Management in many countries has been based largely on herbicides, resulting in the evolution of resistance to multiple modes of action in C. album populations since the 1980s. Research has shown that nonchemical alternatives can be effective against these weeds, including tillage, cover cropping, exploiting allelopathic crop residues, seed predation and fertilization timing, and some biocontrol agents. Future control of C. album and C. murale will require integration of herbicides with more diverse management strategies tailored to the local needs and resources of growers in different countries.},

  Abstract = {Weed behaviour in crop fields has been extensively studied; nevertheless, limited knowl-edge is available for particular cropping systems, such as no-till systems. Improving weed management under no-till conditions requires an understanding of the interaction between crop residues and the seedling emergence process. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of maize and wheat residues, applied in three different quantities (1, the field quantity, 0.5, and 1.5-fold amounts of the field quantity), on the emergence of eight weed species: Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, Digitaria sanguinalis, Echinochloa crus-galli, Setaria pumila, Sonchus oleraceus, and Sorghum halepense. The experiment was conducted over two consecutive years. The results showed that the quantities 1 and 1.5 could suppress seedling emergence by 20 and 44%, respectively, while the quantity 0.5 seems to promote emergence by 22% compared with the control without residues. Weed species showed different responses to crop residues, from C. album showing 56% less emergence to S. halepense showing a 44% higher emergence than the control without residues. Different meteorological conditions in the two-year experiment also exhibited a significant influence on weed species emergence.},

  Abstract = {The mixture of herbicides is routinely used as part of modern weed management practices in intensive agriculture due to the reduction in herbicide application and the risk of side effects. Therefore, to detect the joint action of binary mixtures of the photosystem II, lipid biosynthesis and auxin inhibitor herbicides, additive dose model (ADM) was used as a reference model. Four species of Portulaca oleracea L., Solanum nigrum L., Amaranthus retroflexus L. and Chenopodium album L. were affected by desmedipham + phenmedipham + ethofumesate, chloridazon and clopyralid either single or in binary mixtures. Three binary mixtures of the three herbicides with seven doses of the herbicides were studied in four separate experiments. The values of ED50, ED80 and ED90 were calculated from the three- parameter log-logistic models dose–response curves for each herbicide applied alone or in mixtures of fixed ratios. Results showed that the mixtures efficacy of chloridazon and clopyralid were reduced more than predicted by ADM in all species. In contrast, at 80% and 90% response level, the mixtures of desmedipham + phenmedipham + ethofumesate and clopyralid were mainly synergistic on all species except P. oleracea. In addition, desmedipham + phenmedipham + ethofumesate and chloridazon binary mixtures followed ADM on S. nigrum and A. retroflexus and tended to be antagonistic on C. album and P. oleracea. Hence, there is a large potential for enhancing the specificity of herbicides by using mixtures of desmedipham + phenmedipham + ethofumesate and clopyralid (different site targets), delaying the development of herbicides resistance and diminishing the dose for weed control.},

In total, 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 26 insertion and deletion (INDEL) regions (308 bp in total) were identified from the six chloroplast genomes, presenting a low level of intraspecific variations in comparison to the other angiosperm species. 376 normal simple sequence repeats were identified in all seven C. album chloroplast genomes. The phylogenetic analysis based on all available complete Amaranthaceae chloroplast genomes presents phylogenetic positions of six C. album samples as well as correlation with one of C. album morphological features. Our results provide the way to investigate intraspecific features of C. album chloroplast genomes and also the insights of understanding various intraspecific characteristics including morphological features.},

  Abstract = {A large number of plants produce secondary metabolites known as allelochemicals that are capable of inhibiting the germination of competitive species. This process is known as allelopathy and is mediated by several classes of chemicals, among which phenolic compounds are the most frequent. Thus, plant allelochemicals can be used to control weeds in agricultural systems. In the present work, we analyzed the phenolic profile and phytotoxic potential of different extracts (pure water or water: ethanol 50:50) from Scrophularia striata plants that were collected from two ecological regions in Iran (Pahleh and Lizan). The total polyphenolic content (TPC), as evaluated by the Folin-Ciocolteau method, ranged from 28.3 mg/g in the aqueous extract obtained from the Lizan ecotype to 39.6 mg/g in the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the Pahleh ecotype. Moreover, HPLC analysis was aimed at determining the content of eight phenolic compounds, namely eugenol, rosmarinic acid, hesperetin, hesperedin, trans-ferulic acid, vanillin, and caffeic acid. According to the results, rosmarinic acid appeared to be the most abundant component. The phytotoxic activities of S. striata extracts were examined on the seed germination of a crop species, Lepidium sativum, and two weeds, Chenopodium album and Malva sylvestris. All extracts showed inhibitory effects on these species. The efficiency of these inhibitory effects depended on the type of plant species, origin, and concentration of extract. The highest phytotoxic activity was caused by approximately 1% concentration of extract. The most susceptible weed was M. sylvestris. The extracts that were obtained from the Pahleh ecotype, notably the hydroalcoholic ones, showed higher phytotoxicity against L. sativum, C. album and M. sylvestris. These results encourage further studies to support the use of S. striata as a source of bioherbicides.},

The pathogen-contaminated soil was amended either with 1, 2, or 3% C. album dry biomass, T. harzianum, and T. viride alone, or combinations of either of the two Trichoderma species and plant dry biomass. The lowest shoot and root dry biomass and grain yield of chickpea were recorded in S. rolfsii inoculation alone without any soil amendment (positive control). Plant growth and yield were significantly and gradually increased over positive control with an increase in C. album dry biomass application in the soil. Likewise, soil application of either of the two Trichoderma species significantly enhanced plant growth and yield over positive control under biotic stress of S. rolfsii. Combined application of either T. harzianum or T. viride with 3% dry biomass of C. album also proved highly effective in alleviating biotic stress of S. rolfsii on growth and yield of chickpea.},

  Abstract = {White goosefoot (Chenopodium album) is a common weed being most frequent in several crops. In April 2018, typical symptoms of downy mildew disease were observed on the leaf surface of C. album in pea fields inspected in Hatay province of Turkey. Based on morphological characteristics, molecular sequencing and pathogenicity test, the pathogen was identified as Peronospora variabilis. To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report of downy mildew caused by P. variabilis on C. album in Eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey.},

  Abstract = {Decomposing litter is regarded as the most important source of allelochemicals released into soil. In this study, a greenhouse experiment was designed to assess the net effect of differently aged leaf litter from exotic (Ailanthus altissima, Robinia pseudoacacia and Ulmus pumila) and native riverine trees (Populus alba, Populus nigra and Ulmus minor) on the germination and growth of three herb species (Trifolium repens, Dactylis glomerata and Chenopodium album). We also characterized the chemical composition of litter samples at different litter ages (0, 1, 2 and 3 months) based on phenolic compounds, fibers and ergosterol (as a measure of fungal biomass) contents. Overall, litter from both native and exotic species had a negative effect on shoot and root growth of target species, indicating that phytotoxic effects of litter predominate over positive effects. The inhibition effect of the exotic species was similar or even lower than that of the natives, which does not support the Novel Weapons Hypothesis. Among exotic trees, U. pumila showed the highest inhibition effect on the growth of the target species. T. repens was the most sensitive target species. The importance of litter age varied with both target and donor species. In general, D. glomerata was more inhibited by fresh litter, C. album by half-decomposed litter of U. pumila and R. pseudoacacia and by fresh litter of A. altissima and T. repens was more inhibited by fresh litter of A. altissima and P. alba and by highly decomposed litter of U. minor. The concentration of total phenolics and flavonoids decreased while acid detergent fiber, lignin and ergosterol increased with increasing litter age. Hydroxybenzoic and protocatechuic acids and the flavonoid quercetin were detected in all litter species and at most of the litter ages, while gallic, chlorogenic, vanillic, coumaric and rosmarinic acids were species-specific and they were only detected in fresh litter. Ergosterol concentration appeared as the strongest constrictor of inhibitory effects of litter on understory species. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the net effect of fresh and decomposed litter from exotic and native trees on the growth of understory species.},

  Abstract = {The main aim of the present study was to evaluate benefits of the new technology of sugar beet varieties tolerant to foramsulfuron (FSN) + thiencarbazone-methyl (TCM) herbicides commercialised as Conviso® Smart (four weed management strategies were tested) compared to conventional herbicides (two weed management strategies). Plot-field trials were carried out in Prague (Czech Republic) in 2016–2019. Efficacy on Chenopodium album L., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. B., Abutilon theophrasti Med. and weed beet were evaluated. FSN + TCM controlled all tested weeds very well (efficacy more than 97%) in case of split application with an oil adjuvant. When only one application of FSN + TCM was performed in dry weather conditions, efficacy on C. album and A. theophrasti was insufficient (less than 90%). FSN + TCM fully controlled weed beet at all tested weed management strategies in all experimental years and a residual activity of this herbicide did not allow new plants to emerge. The conventional tank-mixes (TM) controlled C. album and A. retroflexus well (efficacy more than 96%). Efficacy of conventional TM on E. crus-galli ranged from 78 to 100%. Efficacy on A. theophrasti was affected by herbicides used and weather conditions, but did not exceed 92% with either of the conventional TM. The tested conventional herbicides were not able to control weed beet. A relatively high reproductive ability of C. album and A. retroflexus (13,000–157,000 and 7000–10,000 seeds m-2, respectively) was seen in plots where these weeds were not fully controlled. The seed production of A. theophrasti was relatively low (not exceeded 25,000 seeds m-2). However, mature seeds were present in most plots. The reproductive ability of E. crus-galli in sugar beet canopy was much lower (200 - 1800 seeds m-2) compared to the other species, due to its late emergence. Weed beet competed with sugar beet only when other weeds were controlled and weed beet survived the treatment. In these plots, fruit production of weed beet was significantly higher (5000–75,000 fruits m-2). The highest sugar beet yields (78–100 t ha-1) were in weed-free plots or plots with a low weed infestation (split application of FSN + TCM). A significantly lower yield (45–52 t ha-1) was recorded when C. album and A. theophrasti were not sufficiently controlled. In plots where the weed beet was the only weed not controlled, sugar beet yield ranged from 23 to 61 t ha-1. The lowest sugar beet yield (less than 10 t ha-1) was observed in untreated plots where mainly C. album and A. theophrasti predominated. There was a negative relationship between sugar beet yield and total weed biomass.},

In the study, the methanol, aqueous extracts(15, 20, 25 %), essential oil (9, 18, 36 ^iL/Pctri dishes) and hydrosol (4, 8, 10 %) of the rosemary was used. It was determined that the seed germinations of all test plants were inhibited in significant amounts depending on the increase of concentration in all applications performed. The highest effect was obtained from the methanol extracts and it was determined they had that inhibited the germination of seeds of C. album and B. vulgaris at a ratio of 96 %. According to the results obtained, it is considered that the plant of rosemary to have herbicide effect will contribute to the use and development of bioprcparations, which arc sensitive to the human health and environment; and in addition, to the pest control of integrated weeds.},

  Abstract = {We assessed the seed production and shedding pattern of 10 common weed species in two oat fields in Denmark. The aim was to evaluate the possibility of harvesting retained seeds on weeds at crop harvest by a combine harvester based on estimation of weed seed retention. Before flowering, ten plants of each weed species were selected and surrounded by a seed trap comprising of a porous net. When the plants started shedding seeds, the seeds were collected from the traps and counted weekly until oat harvest. Just before oat harvest, the retained seeds on the plants were counted and the ratio of harvestable seeds and shed seeds during the growing season was determined. The seed production and shedding patterns varied between the 2 years. Across both years, Anagallis arvensis L., Capsella bursa-pastoris L. Medik, Chenopodium album L., Geranium molle L., Persicaria maculosa Gray, Polygonum aviculare L., Silene noctiflora L., Sonchus arvensis L., Veronica persica Poir. and Viola arvensis Murray retained on average 61.6%, 52.7%, 67.2%, 58.4%, 32.05%, 59.5%, 95.7%, 23.5%, 51.7% and 33.9%, respectively, of their produced seeds at crop harvest. Silene noctiflora was classified as a good target for harvest weed seed control; C. bursa-pastoris, C. album, G. molle, P. maculosa, S. arvensis and V. arvensis were classified as intermediate targets; and A. arvensis, P. aviculare and V. persica were classified as poor targets.},

In petri dish bioassay, different concentrations (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10%) of aqueous extracts of stem, leaves and whole plant of both weed species were applied on camelina seeds. Among these, 10% whole plant extracts had shown a significant reduction in seed germination and initial growth of camelina. Moreover, weed residues incorporated in soil had inhibitory effect on growth and yield contributing attributes of camelina. Comparatively larger amount of various phenolic acids was determined in whole plant extracts of both weeds by GC-MS. Hence, the results revealed that C. album and C. arvensis are rich source of phenolic acids that greatly inhibited antioxidant activity which ultimately adversely affected the germination; seedling development and seed yield of camelina.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album (common name Bathua) is a widely adapted weed plant facing wide array of temperatures (5–45 °C) during growth and development in North India. Antioxidant defense was studied in C. album leaves under water deficit stress, heat stress, water deficit stress and heat stress combination and water deficit preconditioning followed by heat stress. C. album plants subjected to water deficit stress and heat stress combination showed higher decline in water relations and lesser recovery compared to either stresses alone. Highest H2O2 content, lipid peroxidation and protein damage were observed in plants experiencing water deficit stress and heat stress combination which was coupled with less induction in activities of SOD, CAT and all AsA-GSH cycles enzymes and decline in AsA and GSH pool compared to plants subjected to either stress alone. Water deficit preconditioned C. album plants maintained higher activities of antioxidant defense enzymes and metabolites such as SOD, CAT, POX, DHAR, GSH content and AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG ratios compared to non-preconditioned plants under heat stress. This is the first holistic report on effect of water deficit stress and heat stress combination and water deficit preconditioning followed by heat stress on ROS, damage and antioxidant defense including enzymes and metabolites in C. album. Water deficit stress and heat stress combination was more detrimental in C. album than either of the stresses alone as decline in water relations and increase in oxidative stress and damage was coupled with a decline in antioxidant defense both in enzymes i.e. SOD, CAT and AsA-GSH cycles enzymes and metabolites i.e. AsA and GSH content. Water deficit preconditioning followed by recovery resulted in induction of co-ordinated antioxidant defense in terms of both enzyme activities and metabolites during subsequent heat stress in C. album. Enhanced CAT activity and higher redox pool played a major role in cross tolerance in water deficit preconditioned C. album plants under heat stress.},

In this regard, an in-vitro investigation was performed to evaluate the phytotoxic potential of Nicotiana. plumbaginifolia Viv. on Senna sophera (L.) Roxb., Chenopodium album L., Senna tora (L.) Roxb. and Setaria viridis L. The experiment is aimed to assess the impact of leaf leachate of the allelopathic plant on the biochemical parameters (chlorophyll, carbohydrate, protein and proline content) of recipient weeds. The treatments showed a retarding effect on the biochemical events. Carbohydrate and proline content were increased in test plants whereas protein and chlorophyll content declined in comparison to the control. Aqueous leachates proved to be more suppressive than organic fractions on weeds viz; S. sophera and C. album were suppressed more as compared to S. tora and S. viridis. The GC–MS (gas chromatography–mass spectrophotometry) analysis showed the incidence of different phytochemical entities in the leaf methanolic extract of leaf of N. plumbaginifolia. Forty three compounds were identified representing 98.98% of total methanolic extract composition. The main chemical components were Palmitic acid (17.50%), Palmitoleic acid (14.32%), Oleic acid (13.83), Phytol (8.46%), Neophytadiene (5.47%) and Solasodine (4.23%). The allelopathy of the volatile allelochemicals may perform a vital part in inhibiting the competitive ability of weed species and be one of the alternatives to control weed infestation.},

The objectives were to identify extract concentrations at which 50 and 90% of germination (GR[50 , 90]) and radicle elongation (RR[50 , 90]) were inhibited, to fractionate inflorescence extracts for facilitating identifying the chemical group causing allelopathic effects, and to evaluate the fraction showing the stronger weed suppression effects and the least crop damage. Increasing extract concentration rates (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100% crude extract) were applied to seeds of target crops and weeds. Flower extracts at rates < 0.30 produced GR[50] and RR[50] on H. lanatus, and GR[90] and RR[90] in C. album, while quinoa seeds were not affected. Rice and its target weeds were minimally affected by flower extracts, whereas radicle elongation of all species was significantly reduced. A concentration rate > 0.52 caused the RR[50] on rice and all its target weeds. Fractions were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed to detect phytochemical groups, using specific chemical reagents and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The fraction F3 from aqueous flower extract showed a high content of flavonoids, assumed as the potential allelochemical substance. Total flavonoid content in F3 was quantified as 2.7 mg of quercetin per g F3, i.e., 12.8 mg of quercetin per g of inflorescence material. Additionally, field equivalent extract rates obtained from the harvested fresh inflorescence biomass could be determined. These rates ranged between 90 and 143 mL l-1 of F3 aqueous fraction, while for ethanol F3 were 131 mL l-1. Our results are encouraging for finding sustainable and ecologically friendly alternatives for weed management in crops of high nutritional value, contributing also to counteract the growing problem of herbicide resistance.},

  Abstract = {Whitefly-transmissible begomoviruses (Family-Geminiviridae) are the major pathogens of economically important crops and weeds. In 2004-05, during field surveys in Faisalabad, Pakistan, symptoms of leaf curling and leaf deformations were spotted on leaves of Chenopodium album. Chenopodium album is also known as Bathu (local name). This plant is commonly found in crop fields and around water channels. Fifteen plant leaves showing upward leaf curling were collected from different farmer’s fields. Complete virus and associated satellite molecules were amplified through rolling circle amplification (RCA) followed by restriction digestion with suitable enzyme, cloning and sequencing. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) showed that leaf curling disease of C. album is associated with Pedilanthus leaf curl virus (PeLCV) along with two different types of betasatellite molecules i.e., Digera yellow vein betasatelite (DiYVB), Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB) and one alphasatellite i.e., Ageratum enation alphasatellite (AEA). Sequence analysis showed that PeLCV is a new variant showing 95-98% sequence homology to PeLCV isolated from India and Pakistan. Associated betasatellites i.e., DiYVB and CLCuMB showed 96-99% sequence homology to satellites isolated from India and Pakistan. Ageratum enation alphasatellite associated with PeLCV was also a new combination and showed 99% sequence homology with other isolates from Pakistan. This is the first report of PeLCV and associated satellites infecting C. album. The data presented in this paper would help in understanding the diversity and etiology of begomoviruses in C. album.},

  Abstract = {Background: The application of appropriately timed herbicide is an affordable approach to optimize the activity of herbicides. Objective: The study aims to determine the best night-time to apply glufosinate, oxyfluorfen, and paraquat with emphasis on the role of the period of dark exposure after herbicide application. Methods: The study was conducted at two fields in Iran, the fresh weight: dry weight (FW/DW) ratio of five weed species treated with glufosinate, oxyfluorfen, and paraquat at 0.5x and 1x of labeled doses after sunset or before sunrise was assessed. Results: The application time-of-day effect for tested herbicides was affected by application dose of herbicide and was more pronounced when the herbicides were applied at the 0.5x as compared to at the 1x. In 14 out of 18 cases, foliage tissues were more desiccated with the sunset applications of herbicides at the 0.5x than with the sunrise applications. When applications were made after sunset, an increased foliage tissues desiccation of Chenopodium album L. treated with paraquat (29.6%) in field 1 and C. album treated with glufosinate (27.2%) or paraquat (23.7%), and Malva neglecta Wallr. treated with glufosinate (21.6%) or oxyfluorfen (31.6%) in field 2 was detected by increasing the dose from 0.5x to 1x. Except 4 out of 18 cases, the herbicides applied either at the 0.5x after sunset or at the 1x before sunrise resulted in similar FW/DW ratio in all weed species. Conclusions: If contact herbicides are used at night-time after sunset, it is possible to take advantage of their reduced doses.},

  Abstract = {The aim of this study carried out in 2017–2018 was to determine the effect of white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.), which is known to have an allelopathic effect on the germination of some weed and cultural crops seeds. In addition to weeds, Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L. and Solanum nigrum L., cultural plants such as Zea mays L., Beta vulgaris L., were used in this study. It has been shown that the seed germination rate was decreased by the increased concentration of white cabbage post-harvest leaves extractions, which were made with different concentrations of aqueous and methanol extracts (30, 40, and 50%). The methanol extract was found to be more effective in germination. According to these results, S. nigrum and Z. mays seeds were less affected than A. retroflexus, C. album and B. vulgaris seeds. In the light of these data, it is observed that extracts obtained from white cabbage can be effective on some weeds; however, it was concluded that in order to reach more definite conclusions, studies on the subject should be increased, and similar studies should be continued under greenhouse or field conditions.},

  Abstract = {The present study investigated integrated effects of two allelopathic plant water extracts (WE) (Ambrosia artemisiifolia [AMBEL] and Xanthium strumarium [XANST]) and a herbicide (mesotrione) on morphological (height and fresh weight of plants) and physiological (pigments content) parameters of Abutilon theophrasti and Chenopodium album. Also, the study aimed to identify the main components of AMBEL and XANST WE and to evaluate their potential allelopathic effects. Of the 18 investigated compounds, 13 were detected in both tested WE, and p-coumaric acid was the leading component in AMBEL, while quinic acid was the predominant component of XANST. The WE of both weed species and their mixtures with the herbicide exhibited more powerful allelopathic effects on fresh weight and content of pigments than on the height of A. theophrasti and C. album. The results showed that all measured parameters of both weeds were inhibited in treatments with mesotrione and its mix with AMBEL and XANST WE. The data revealed a highly significant difference in effects (P < 0.05) between control weeds and those treated with AMBEL WE and mesotrione, where the inhibition of fresh weight was over 90%, while the inhibition of pigments content exceeded 80%, and plant height was inhibited by over 70%.},

  Abstract = {The effects of aqueous extracts of the aromatic plant Melissa officinalis were studied on the seed germination and early seedlings growth of ten summer annual species in Petri dish bioassays and pot experiments. The in vitro experiments on the aqueous extracts from M. officinalis on seed germination shows that the extracts of 5 and 10% were the most active inhibitors for all the studied weed species. Seed germination reduction by the aqueous extracts was up to 54% of the untreated seed lot for each species. On the contrary, the concentration of 1% resulted in germination reduction ranging from 1 to 11%, while in some of the weed species (P. minor, S. nigrum, P. angulata and C. albida) the effect was rather stimulatory. This finding is in full agreement with “novel weapons hypothesis” and supports that native plants compared with invasive (like C. albida and P. angulata) are affected more due to the absence of tolerance or resistance to the allelochemicals. The allelopathy RI of aqueous extracts of lemon balm was negative in most cases, while in the case of 10% concentration, emergence was reduced by 58, 54, 48, 46 and 43% for X. strumarium, C. album, S. faberi, C. canadensis and C. bonariensis, respectively. The allelopathic activity of M. officinalis could be exploited in future studies, to identify and isolate the allelochemicals, as models for future herbicides for integrated weed management.},

  Abstract = {Studies on the isolation of soil-born fungi and their phytotoxicity against weeds and millet were conducted in the Centre of Biotechnology and Microbiology at the University of Peshawar in 2015. For this purpose, soil from the three botanical gardens in Peshawar valley – the Botanical Garden of the Pakistan Forest Institute (PFI), the Islamia College Botanical Garden and the University of Peshawar Botanical Garden in Aza Khel – were collected and analyzed for the identification and isolation of different species of soil-born fungi. A total of seven species of fungi were isolated from the three botanical gardens, 5 species (Alternaria spp., Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium spp., and Rhizopus spp.) from the botanical garden of the Pakistan Forest Institute, 4 species (Fusarium spp., Cladosporium spp., Penicillium spp., and A. flavus) from Islamia College Botanical Garden and 3 species (A. flavus, Alternaria spp and A. niger) from the University of Peshawar botanical garden in Aza Khel. Among these, A. flavous was found in all three botanical gardens with higher frequency such as in PFI (90%), in Islamia College Botanical Garden (65%) and the University of Peshawar Botanical Garden in Aza Khel (50%). This species produces a large number of colonies such as in PFI (56), Islamia College (24) and in the University of Peshawar (7) colonies per petri dish. In the second part of the studies, crude extract of A. flavus was collected and tested on the seed mortality of five different weeds and millet. Those weeds were A. retroflexus, C. album, Sonchus arvensis, Galium aparine and Viola arvensis. Crude extract of A. flavus with different concentrations (i.e., 10, 100 and 1000 µg/mL) were prepared and applied on weed seeds kept in the petri dishes. Due to the toxic effect of the extract of A. flavus, all weed seeds were killed, i.e., A. retroflexus (100%), C. album (100%), S. arvensis (100%), G. aparine (100%) and V. arvensis (100%). Similarly crude extract of A. flavus also killed millet seeds completely (100%). Therefore, our results suggest that extract of A. flavus could be used as a biological control agent for controlling weeds through targeted spray as well as in turf and commercials areas.},

Results indicated that a higher proportion of seeds originating from lower slope positions emerged compared with seeds originating from the backslope or upper slope. The timing of emergence was the same for all seed source locations. There was no influence of overwintering location on weed emergence. Regardless of the seed source, we observed faster emergence and growth of C. album planted in the lower slope, where soil conditions were more conducive to growth. These experiments will support the development of new strategies and decision aids to improve weed management.},

There was minimal soybean injury (=2%) from treatments evaluated. Glyphosate/dicamba applied at application timing of up to 5, 15, and 25 cm weeds, controlled Amaranthus spp. (pigweed spp.) 87-96, 94-99, and 99%; Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) 93-99, 97-99, and 99-100%; Chenopodium album (lambsquarters) 89-99, 95-100, and 99-100%; Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) 81-84, 94-96, and 96-97%; Setaria faberi (giant foxtail) 37-90, 77-98, and 99-100%; and Setaria viridis (green foxtail) 94-96, 99, and 99-100%, respectively. Additionally, glyphosate/dicamba applied POST at 900, 1350, and 1800 g·ae·ha-1 controlled Amaranthus spp. 90-97, 95-98, and 97-99%; A. artemisiifolia 95-98, 97-99, and 99-100%; C. album 92-99, 95-100, and 98-100%; E. crus-galli 84-88, 93-94, and 95-96%; S. faberi 74-95, 75-97, and 79-98%; and S. viridis 98, 98-99, and 98-100%, respectively. Weed interference reduced DR soybean yield as much as 51% compared to the highest yielding treatments. Results indicate that glyphosate/dicamba applied POST at the label doses can provide an adequate control of troublesome weeds in DR soybean. Weed control was generally most consistent when glyphosate/dicamba was applied at the highest registered dose in Ontario (1800 g·ae·ha-1) and when weeds were up to 25 cm tall.},

  Abstract = {Fungal strain PA-2 was isolated from infected poplar leaves from the Ping'an District, Haidong City of Qinghai Province, China. Based on the culture characteristics and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence of its 16S rDNA, the strain was identified as Aureobasidium pullulans. The culture and metabolites of strain PA-2 showed high herbicidal potential to five tested weeds Galium aparine var. tenerum, Chenopodium album, Malva crispa, Polygonum lapathifolium and Avena fatua. For the in vitro test, 5 days after the detached leaves were inoculated with PA-2 culture, all leaves infected by the hyphae and became black and rotten. For the in vivo test, a metabolite filtrate of PA-2 culture was sprayed over the living weed plants, and five days after inoculation, the weed plants became withered and necrotic. Seven days after inoculation, the fresh weight reductions of G. aparine var. tenerum, C. album, M. crispa, P. lapathifolium and A. fatua were 87.25, 78.46, 82.25, 62.11, and 80.27%, respectively. Galium aparine var. tenerum and M. crispa exhibited significant reductions in fresh weight. The bio-safety test on the five crops showed no significant plant height reductions, which was also observed for wheat (Triticum aestivum), faba bean (Vicia faba), and barley (Hordeum vulgare). By contrast, oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and pea (Pisum sativum) exhibited light spots but no significant reductions in plant height. These results indicated that A. pullulans could be a potential microbial herbicide for the control of the target weeds in crops. Optimization of the carbon and nitrogen sources for cultural media and substances for solid-state fermentation indicated that PA-2 had better colony growth and spore production with the optimal carbon source of glucose (C4), nitrogen source of soybean flour (N2), and the optimal substance was wheat bran. The results in this study provide useful information for the development of A. pulluans PA-2 as an herbicide for bio-control of the weed.},

  Abstract = {The increased availability and high adoption rate of glyphosate-tolerant crops have selected for several glyphosate-resistant weed species. The response of representative weed species to glyphosate was assessed to provide insights and tools for optimizing glyphosate use for economic, agronomic and environmental reasons. Anoda cristata, Chenopodium album, Digitaria sanguinalis, Eleusine indica and Portulaca oleracea were grown outdoors in pots containing commercial potting medium. An increasing dose of glyphosate was applied to these species at three growth stages. Weed response was evaluated visually compared to the nontreated control and shoot dry weights were recorded. Fecundity was also determined. Based on visual evaluations, the dose of glyphosate required to attain 90% control of the species tested exhibited an application rate margin up to 28.5-fold compared to recommended rate, denoting a potential for rate optimization. Except for A. cristata, the recommended dose of glyphosate could be reduced by 30%–60% and still achieve 90% or greater control. The order of species sensitivity, based on effective dose 50 (ED50 )values, was E. indica > C. album > D. sanguinalis > P. oleracea > A. cristata. The ratio of ED90/ED50 was constant, indicating that increasing the glyphosate dose 8.7-fold would reduce weed biomass 1.8-fold. In most cases, the fecundity-avoidance biomass threshold (i.e., the maximum allowable weed biomass for herbicide application in order to prevent weed seed production and dispersal) for glyphosate was below the ED90 value. Complimentary measures such as fecundity-avoidance biomass threshold will improve herbicide evaluation procedures and preserve the effectiveness of herbicides, including glyphosate, on sensitive species, an important issue particularly when action to reduce herbicide resistance development is highly required.},

  Abstract = {The alleles responsible for herbicide resistance in weeds can result in a fitness cost within affected plants. Over 200 cases of resistance to triazine herbicides have been confirmed in a wide range of weed species globally. In New Zealand, Chenopodium album L. was the first species reported as resistant to triazines. Several studies have already shown that triazine resistance in weeds is associated with fitness costs. Our current study provides further information about fitness penalties caused by triazine resistance during the vegetative growth phase of C. album. Triazine-resistant phenotypes produced less biomass and were shorter than susceptible ones prior to the onset of flowering. At an early stage of growth, triazine-resistant plants had lower photosynthetic efficacy and growth rates than susceptible plants, indicated by lower net assimilation rate (NAR) and relative growth rate (RGR), respectively. However, at a later stage of growth, the resistant plants had greater RGR values than susceptible phenotypes, though there were no significant differences in NAR between triazine-resistant and susceptible plants at this later stage. The triazine-resistant plants had less capacity for vegetative growth than susceptible plants during competition with wheat, indicating less ability to capture resources by triazine-resistant plants under competition. Overall, this study has revealed that the triazine resistance allele caused a substantial fitness cost to C. album only at the early phase of vegetative growth stage; thus, the use of crop competition to try managing triazine-resistant C. album plants should occur during this early phase.},

  Abstract = {Organic cropping systems are characterized by soil-disturbance events that can be diversified over years through crop rotations and within seasons by varying planting dates. The Farming Systems Project at Beltsville, MD, USA, is a long-term experiment that includes three organic rotations, corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and corn-soybean-wheat-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Analysis of weed presence and cover over the first 18 yr of this experiment revealed that the tall, erect annual broadleaf weeds smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), horseweed (Erigeron canadensis L.), jimsonweed (Datura stramonium L.), and/or velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) were most prominent in corn and soybean. Generally, these species exhibited traits adapted to the disturbance regimes, nutrient availability, crop environment and duration, and local meteorological conditions associated with the summer annual corn and soybean crops. Abundance of A. hybridus, D. stramonium, and A. theophrasti were controlled primarily by rotation diversity, whereby presence and cover of these species were highest in the short corn-soybean rotation and lowest in the longer rotations that had more diverse seasonal soil-disturbance regimes. Early-season temperature was the primary factor controlling C. album presence and cover, which were higher at lower temperatures associated with earlier planting dates. Higher early-season precipitation was the primary factor associated with higher presence of annual grass species. The relative abundance of species in organic corn and soybean was determined primarily by the diversity of crops and disturbance operations in rotation, the timing of spring tillage and planting, and annual meteorological conditions driving emergence periodicity.},

  Abstract = {Continuous use of heavy machinery in fields and frequent farm traffic sometimes result in soil compaction. Soil compaction reduces the oxygen (O2) concentration in soil capillaries and hence lowers the O2 availability for germinating seeds. We investigated how reduced O2 levels changed germination behavior of weeds to elucidate their potential to adapt to O2-deficient soils (compacted, compressed, and waterlogged soils and soils with hard surfaces). Two similar laboratory experiments were conducted with five O2 treatments (20.9%, 15%, 10%, 5%, and 2.5%). The germination percentage of the invasive weed hairy fiddleneck [Amsinckia menziesii (Lehm.) A. Nelson & J.F. Macbr. var. menziesii] and the common weeds common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and Persian speedwell (Veronica persica Poir) was not significantly reduced at 15% O2. The germination of scarlet pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis L. ssp. arvensis), silky windgrass [Apera spica-venti (L.) Beauv.], catchweed bedstraw (Galium aparine L.), and knawel (Scleranthus annuus L.) was significantly reduced at 15% O2. The highest germination was obtained at 20.9% O2 for blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.), A. spica-venti, G. aparine, annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.), wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.), scentless chamomile [Tripleurospermum inodorum (L.) Sch. Bip.], field violet (Viola arvensis Murray) and the less common weeds A. arvensis and S. annuus. Distribution of flora in the landscape may change on O2-deficient soils by reducing germination of some species such as A. arvensis and S. annuus and favoring others like A. menziesii and C. album. The ability to germinate at 2.5% and 5% O2 may contribute to explain why A. myosuroides and A. menziesii have become successful as weeds on O2-deficient soils, as they maintained a germination percentage between 34% and 58% at 2.5% O2.},

  Abstract = {Herbicide-resistant weeds are a growing concern globally; in response, new herbicide resistance traits are being inserted into crops. Isoxaflutole-resistant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] will provide a new mode of action for use in this crop. Ten experiments were conducted over a 2-yr period (2017, 2018) to determine herbicide interactions between isoxaflutole and metribuzin on soybean injury, weed control efficacy, and soybean yield on a range of soil types. Soybean leaf-bleaching injury caused by isoxaflutole was most severe at sites with higher levels of rainfall after application. Control of weed species with isoxaflutole (52.5, 79, and 105 g ai ha-1) and metribuzin (210, 315, and 420 g ai ha-1) differed by site based on amount of rainfall after application. At sites where there was sufficient rainfall for herbicide activation, isoxaflutole at all rates controlled common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), Amaranthus spp., common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) >90%; metribuzin at all rates controlled Amaranthus spp. and witchgrass (Panicum capillare L.) >80%. Control of every weed species evaluated was reduced when there was limited rainfall after herbicide application. The co-application of isoxaflutole + metribuzin resulted in additive or synergistic interactions for the control of C. album, Amaranthus spp., A. artemisiifolia, A. theophrasti, Setaria spp., barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv], and P. capillare. Isoxaflutole and metribuzin can be an effective management strategy for common annual broadleaf and grass weeds in Ontario if timely rainfall events occur after herbicide application.},

  Abstract = {Remediation with plants is a technology used to decrease soil or water contamination. In this study we assessed the remediation potential of two weed species (Chenopodium album and Tripleurospermum inodorum) in a moderately metal-contaminated area. Metal concentrations were studied in roots, stems and leaves, in order to assess correlations in metal concentrations between those in soil and plants. Furthermore, we calculated bioaccumulation factor (BAF), bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) values to study the accumulation of metals from soil to plants and translocation within plants. We found correlation in metal concentrations between soil and plants. The metal accumulation potential was low in both species, indicating low BAF and BCF values. In contrast, high TF values were found for Mn, Ni, Sr, Zn, Ba, Fe, Cu and Pb in C. album, and for Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn and Sr in T. inodorum. Our results demonstrated that the potential of C. album and T. inodorum might be limited in phytoextraction processes; however, when accumulated, metals are successfully transported to aboveground plant organs. Thus, to achieve the efficient remediation of metal-contaminated soils, removal of the aboveground plant organs is recommended, by which soil disturbance can also be avoided.},

Accumulated Cd in C. album reached to 0.32 mg for each plant under soil Cd stress of 15 mg. Thus, Cd accumulation capability of weeds was decreased with the increased using rate of Cd and it was between 1.64% and 4.96%. After 45 days? of Cd stress, the redistribution of Cd content in the root and shoot was studied from underground parts to above ground parts. The outcome confirmed that weed species had sophisticated acceptance to Cd and could accumulate affectively. They did not show any abnormal growth appearance even in soils having 15 mg kg-1 Cd, and for C. album, the Cd content in the roots was up to 264.32 mg kg-1 dry biomass while in the shoots it was about 126.55 mg kg-1. This signified that three weeds behaved as decent accumulating plant although they showed infirm ability in transporting Cd from below ground biomass to above ground biomass. Afterwards, shoot:soil and root:soil further proved that, studied weed species were likely to uptake more Cd as a way of diminution of the mobility of Cd. So, this research predicts that using green technology as a process of phyto-mitigation of trace elements from the defiled soils would be a good choice.},

The studies were conducted in a controlled environment to determine the response of C. album and A. theophrasti to mesotrione using dose–response curves created based on plant dry weight, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and chlorophyll content. The obtained effective dose values showed that the studied weeds were susceptible to reduced doses of mesotrione. ED95 values estimated for both species for dry weight and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were lower than the recommended dose rate (120 g a.i. ha-1), with less than 85 g a.i. ha-1 needed to achieve a reduction of 95%, compared with untreated plants, while ED95 value (A. theophrasti: 182 g a.i. ha-1 and C. album: 180 g a.i. ha-1) for chlorophyll content for both species was above the recommended dose rates. Consequently, dry weight and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are suitable for estimating the plant response to mesotrione, while chlorophyll content is not.},

  Abstract = {Aim: We hypothesised that during the Holocene, the distributions of species such as crop weeds have been significantly influenced by human activity. We aimed to (a) identify the main centres of diversity of the Chenopodium album agg. species and (b) test if these species colonised Europe from western Asia, most likely due to the westward expansion of agriculture in the Neolithic period. Location: Eurasia. Taxon: Chenopodium album aggregate (Amaranthaceae). Methods: Three cpDNA regions were sequenced in 904 individuals, from 26 species of the C. album aggregate. A dated phylogeny was inferred and this was used to establish relationships among the haplotypes and to estimate their divergence times. The group's main centres of diversity were inferred by comparing species and haplotype richness between Europe, the Mediterranean, western Asia, central Asia and Siberia. Results: The most haplotype-diverse area for the entire C. album aggregate is central Asia. Interestingly, Europe is poor in terms of haplotype diversity, showing the same level of diversity as the western Asian region. The pairwise genetic differentiation between Europe, the Mediterranean and western Asia is lower than between any of these regions and either central Asia or Siberia. This points to the origin of the European Chenopodium species pool as being in western Asia. In some phylogenetically-defined clades, species could not be distinguished based on cpDNA haplotypes due to a high level of haplotype sharing. However, in others, the haplotype variation follows the species boundaries. Main conclusions: Using the C. album agg. species as a model, we show the importance of central Asia as one of the main centres of diversity for weedy species. However, the group's colonisation of Europe had its origins in western Asia, highlighting the importance of human-mediated dispersal of ruderal and weed plant species accompanying the westward spread of agriculture in the Neolithic period.},

  Abstract = {The present study was aimed at screening allelopathic potential of papaya (Carica papaya L.) leaf solvent extracts and by using sandwich method (dried powder) against some major weeds of wheat viz. Phalaris minor, Avena fatua, Chenopodium album, Euphorbia helioscopia and Rumex dentatus on filter paper and soil. Amongst them, methanolic extracts showed highest seed germination inhibition of E. helioscopia (50%), followed by P. minor (45%) and A. fatua (41%). Similarly, radical length of R. dentatus was inhibited by 50%, followed by 49% in P. minor, while the plumule length of C. album and P. minor was inhibited by 49% and 48%, respectively. Sandwich bioassay also exhibited inhibitory effects on soil medium having germination inhibition of 57% for E. helioscopia, followed by 49% for P. minor and 39% for A. fatua. The radical length was inhibited best for R. dentatus and P. minor with 41% and 35%, respectively. On the other hand, plumule length was inhibited by 45% in C. album and 33% in P. minor. Based on the results, it is concluded that C. papaya showed good allelopathic activity that can be used in herbicide screening program for weed control.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium ficifolium Sm. is an invasive weedy species, one of the main targets for weed control in Korea. In this study, we presented the first complete chloroplast genome of C. ficifolium which is 151,823 bp long and has four subregions: 83,668 bp of large single copy (LSC) and 17,937 bp of small single copy (SSC) regions are separated by 25,109 bp of inverted repeat (IR) regions including 129 genes (84 protein-coding genes, eight rRNAs, and 37 tRNAs). The overall GC content of the chloroplast genome is 37.3% and those in the LSC, SSC, and IR regions are 35.3%, 31.0%, and 42.7%, respectively.

  Abstract = {Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) is one of the most troublesome weeds in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and corn (Zea mays L.) fields in northeast China. In 2017, a C. album population that survived imazethapyr at the recommended field rate was collected from a soybean field in Heilongjiang Province in China. Experiments were conducted to determine the basis of resistance to imazethapyr and investigate the herbicide-resistance pattern in C. album. Dose-response tests showed that the resistant population (R) displayed high resistance to imazethapyr (20-fold) compared with the susceptible population (S). An in vitro acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity assay indicated that the ALS of the R population was resistant to imazethapyr compared with the ALS of the S population. Sequence analysis of the ALS gene revealed that the GCA was replaced by ACA at amino acid position 122, which resulted in an alanine to threonine substitution (Ala-122-Thr) in the R population. The R population displayed cross-resistance to thifensulfuron-methyl and flumetsulam but susceptibility to bispyribac-sodium, flucarbazone, glyphosate, mesotrione, and fomesafen. These results confirmed that the basis of imazethapyr resistance in C. album was conferred by the Ala-122-Thr substitution in the ALS enzyme. This is the first report of the target-site basis of ALS-inhibiting herbicide resistance in C. album.},

  Abstract = {Differences in plant biomass/plant seed production relationship imply that plants suppressed by competition to the same extent, may not suffer the same reduction in seed number setting. This size-dependent process evidenced by the quantitative relationship between plant growth and allocation to reproductive structures can be considered from an allometric perspective. The aim of this study was to describe the reproductive allometry of four annual weed species of the Pampas cropping systems by modelling the plant biomass/plant seed production relationship in Digitaria sanguinalis, Amaranthus hybridus, Setaria verticillata and Chenopodium album. To achieve this goal, two experiments developed during two consecutive growing periods (Experiments 1 and 2) were set up under greenhouse conditions. Weed species were grown in monocultures and in binary mixtures, with each other and with soybean crop, to obtain plants of different size after the effect of intra and interspecific competition. Data per plant regarding biomass versus seed number production considering monocultures and mixtures from Experiments 1 and 2 were analysed for each species using linear regression. Parameters of the linear functions fitted for C. album, S. verticillata and D. sanguinalis did not differ between experiments and data were pooled. Thus, three single specific models were obtained with the same intercept of zero (y-axis intercept when x = 0 was zero) and different slopes, 1122, 69 and 130 seeds g plant biomass-1 respectively. In the case of A. hybridus, the slopes were different in Experiments 1 (123 seeds g plant biomass-1) and 2 (74 seeds g plant biomass-1). Moreover, reproductive allocation changed allometrically under highly competitive stress since small plants failed to set seeds, unless a plant biomass threshold was attained (x-axis intercept when y = 0 was positive). Besides the ecological interpretation in reproductive output, implications in weed management are considered.},

Phalaris minor (bunchgrass), Avena fatua (wild oat), Chenopodium album (pigweed), Euphorbia helioscopia (sun spurge) and Rumex dentatus (toothed dock) of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) by employing sandwich method (powdered needles) on filter paper, soil and agar. The data attained from statistical analysis revealed that methanolic needle extract possessed the highest germination percentage inhibition for T. aestivum, followed by C. album and A. fatua applied in soil. Similarly, maximum radical length suppression was observed for R. dentatus, followed by C. album. The plumule length retardation was noted best in R. dentatus, followed by A. fatua. The application of methanolic P. roxburghii extract was responsible for reduction in seed germination, radical and plumule length of wheat. Based on results, it can be concluded that methanolic Pinus needles extract possesses potential inhibitory effects that required for further detailed analysis to establish allelopathic potential and onward application to be used as phytoherbicide.},

The identification of phytotoxins in local weed species (Datura stramonium, Achyranthes aspera, Chenopodium album, Calotropis procera, C. murale and Melilotus indica) was done through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to check their herbicidal potential against P. hysterophorus. Additionally, filter paper petri plate based and soil filled pot experiments were conducted in laboratory and wire house to evaluate the pre- and post-emergence herbicidal potential of plant water extract of D. stramonium alone and in combination with A. aspera, C. album, C. procera, C. murale and M. indica at 2.5, 5 and 10% (w/v) concentrations against germination and seedling growth of P. hysterophorus. The phytotoxins detected in extracts of these plant species were quercetin, gallic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, m-coumaric, sinapinic, caffeic, benzoic and syringic acids with variable concentrations. Total highest concentration of phytotoxins (61.37 mg L-1) was found in A. aspera while the lowest concentration (7.69 mg L-1) was found in C. album aqueous extract. Significant reduction in germination and seedling growth of P. hysterophorus was shown by all extract combinations that increased in direct proportion to their concentrations. The 10% water extract of D. stramonium in combination with C. procera and A. aspera proved to be the best as they resulted maximum reductions in germination percentage (100 and 95%), shoot length (67 and 62%), and shoot dry weight (67 and 78%) of P. hysterophorus, respectively.},

  Abstract = {Beneficial arthropods provide important ecosystem services in terms of arthropod pest and weed management, but these services can be adversely affected by farming practices such as tillage. This study investigated the impact of two tillage operations (zone tillage and moldboard plow) on the activity density of several beneficial, epigeal arthropod taxa, and postdispersal weed seed and prey removal in sugar beet agroecosystems. In addition, four omnivorous ground beetle species were selected for a weed-seed choice feeding assay, whereas a single species was selected for a weed-seed age preference assay. Ground beetles were the most commonly collected taxon (via pitfall sampling), with only a few dominant species. Tillage operation did not affect ground beetle activity density; however, spider, centipede, and rove beetle activity densities were higher in the reduced-tillage treatment. Live prey consumption was similar between tillage practices, with more prey consumed during nocturnal hours. More weed seeds were consumed in the reduced-tillage treatment, whereas weed-seed preference differed between the four weed species tested [Setaria pumila (Poir.) Roem. & Schult., Echinochloa crus-galli (L.), Kochia scoparia (L.), and Chenopodium album (L.)]. In the weed-seed choice feeding assay, significantly more broad-leaf weed seeds (C. album and K. scoparia) were consumed compared with grassy weed seeds (E. crus-galli and S. pumila). No preference for seed age was detected for E. crus-galli, but Harpalus pensylvanicus (De Geer) preferred old C. album seeds over fresh seeds. Zone tillage is compatible with ecosystem services, providing critical habitat within agricultural ecosystems needed to conserve beneficial, edaphic arthropods.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Herbicide hormesis may play a role in the evolution of weed resistance by increasing resistance selection. A standard herbicide rate may be subtoxic to resistant plants and make them more fit than untreated plants. If this increase in fitness is ultimately expressed in reproductive traits, resistance genes can accumulate more rapidly and exacerbate resistance evolution by magnifying the selection differential between resistant and sensitive plants. The hypothesis of hormetically enhanced reproductive fitness was studied for a photosystem II (PSII) target-site resistant (TSR) biotype of Chenopodium album exposed to the triazinone metamitron in comparison with its wild-type. RESULTS: Both biotypes showed an initial hormetic growth increase at different doses leading to fitness enhancements of between 19% and 61% above untreated plants. However, hormetic effects only resulted in higher fitness at maturity in resistant plants with a maximum stimulation in seed yield of 45% above untreated plants. Applying realistic metamitron rates, reproductive fitness of resistant plants was increased by 15–32%. CONCLUSIONS: Agronomically relevant doses of metamitron induced considerable hormesis in a PSII-TSR C. album genotype leading to enhanced relative fitness through reproductive maturity. This increase in relative fitness suggests an impact on resistance selection and can compensate for the oft-reported fitness costs of the mutation studied. Field rates of herbicides can, thus, not only select for resistant plants, but also enhance their reproductive fitness. The finding that herbicide hormesis can be eco-evolutionary important may have important implications for understanding the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

  Abstract = {Optimizing diquat efficacy with the use of adjuvants may broaden the spectrum of weed control, but relevant research towards this direction is limited. Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of diquat applied alone and with six commercial adjuvants (surfactants and oil-based adjuvants) on various weed species. Diquat effect was evaluated in two field experiments on natural populations of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare L.) and burning nettle (Urtica urens L.) along with two greenhouse trials on rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum L.). In field or greenhouse experiments, all the adjuvants significantly increased the control of C. album, P. aviculare, and L. rigidum, from 48, 42 and 7%, up to 82, 74 and 67%, respectively, in terms of fresh weight reduction, but to a different extent for each adjuvant. U. urens was totally (100%) controlled in terms of visual estimation either with diquat or with diquat plus any adjuvant. The differences in the effect of diquat applied with adjuvants mainly depended on the weed species examined and they were not proportional to the surface tension reduction of the spray solution caused by the adjuvants. Overall, the surfactants and the oil-based adjuvants examined in this study considerably enhanced the effect of diquat; this can broaden the spectrum of weed control against broadleaf and grass weeds in orchards and non-crop areas. The results are discussed in relation with the classification of the adjuvants.},

  Abstract = {Most previous research on changes in weed abundance and community composition in cropping systems has focused on field crops. The study presented here examined changes in the weed seedbank and aboveground biomass in four organic vegetable cropping systems over a 10-yr period. The systems included an Intensive system with six crops per 4-yr rotation, an Intermediate system with one cash crop per year, a Bio-extensive system with alternating cash crop and tilled fallow years plus prevention of seed rain, and a Ridge-tillage system with one cash crop per year. Systems also differed in the types and number of cover crops between cash crops. During the course of the experiment, the weed community shifted from one dominated by summer annual broadleaf species that reproduce at the end of their lives to a community dominated by summer and winter annuals that mature rapidly. This shift in community composition can be attributed to the change in land use from conventionally managed corn (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to organic vegetable production. In particular, crop rotations with diverse preplantings and postharvest tillage dates interrupted the life cycle of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and pigweed species (Amaranthus spp.: mostly Powell amaranth [Amaranthus powellii S. Watson], with small numbers of redroot pigweed [Amaranthus retroflexus L.] and smooth pigweed [Amaranthus hybridus L.]), while favoring a diverse assemblage of quickly maturing species. The study thus demonstrates that an appropriate crop rotation can control the seedbank of weeds like C. album that potentially persist well in the soil. The Ridge-tillage system greatly reduced the frequency and depth of tillage relative to other systems while effectively suppressing perennial weeds. The early-reproducing annuals, however, became more abundant in the Ridge-tillage system than in the other systems, primarily due to escapes along the edge of the scraped ridges. The tilled fallow periods coupled with prevention of seed rain in the Bio-extensive system substantially reduced weed abundance through time and relative to the other systems.},

  Abstract = {Previous research has shown that strip-tillage (ST) systems conserve soil, reduce production costs, and save time for growers compared with intensive-tillage systems. In contrast to these well-documented benefits, we have limited information on weed community dynamics and management risks in ST corn (Zea mays L.) production systems in the northern Corn Belt. Therefore, we conducted research in 2015 and 2016 to characterize weed community composition, emergence patterns, and aboveground productivity in an ST corn/no-tillage (NT) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation that was established in 2007 compared with a long-term intensive-tillage chisel-plow (CP) continuous-corn system. Fifteen or more weed species were identified in nontreated quadrats in each cropping system in each year. Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) was the most abundant weed species across systems and years. Chenopodium album densities were similar between CP and ST corn phases and were approximately 2-fold greater compared with the NT soybean phase. Other abundant weed species occurred at much lower densities than C. album. In each year, cumulative emergence of nontreated weed communities was described best by a logistic function in each cropping system. Maximum weed community emergence was greater in CP corn than ST corn phases in 2015, but did not differ in 2016. In the ST corn phase, most (about 75%) weed community emergence occurred in the in-row (tilled) zone compared with the between-row (nondisturbed) zone. Total late-season weed shoot biomass did not differ between nontreated CP and ST corn phases in either year, with C. album accounting for >85% of total weed biomass in these phases. These results suggest that weed community composition, total emergence, and productivity were similar between CP and ST corn phases after 10 yr. Our findings, coupled with previous research that showed favorable agronomic performance and greater soil conservation associated with the long-term ST corn/NT soybean system, suggest that production risks are no greater than a CP corn system, while processes that underpin ecosystem services are enhanced. These results provide strong evidence to support grower adoption of ST practices as an alternative to intensive tillage.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album is a troublesome arable weed species which has evolved resistance to dicamba in New Zealand. The objective of this work was to investigate the patterns of absorption, translocation and metabolism of dicamba in resistant and susceptible C. album populations. No significant differences in absorption by the two populations were measured, with over 80% of applied herbicide entering the plants of both populations during the 5 days after application. The 14C from dicamba was also readily translocated out of the treated leaf, with this occurring more rapidly in resistant plants than susceptible plants. The majority of the 14C from dicamba was translocated into untreated leaves in both populations. However, by 5 days after application, 18.4% of the absorbed 14C from dicamba was found in stem material for susceptible plants, compared with only 5.1% for resistant plants. No dicamba metabolism was detected for either population. Based on the results of this study, the mechanism of resistance to dicamba in C. album could not be adequately explained by differential patterns of absorption, translocation or metabolism, but the mechanism appears to differ from previously published cases of dicamba resistance.},

(Amaranthaceae) on Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae) behavior, host preference, transmission, and fitness under field and laboratory studies. In the field, several weeds, besides C. album, were collected, including: Sisymbrium altissimum L. (Brassicaceae), Erodium cicutarium L., Lactuca serriola L., Solanum sarrachoides Sendtner (Solanaceae), and S. dulcamara L. (Solanaceae). All weeds were serologically tested for the presence of PVY. From all weeds collected, 2.3 and 34% of C. album and S. sarrachoides, respectively, were PVY-positive. From those positive samples, 72% of the PVY found were PVY N; the remaining 28% was PVY O. In addition, several aphid species were collected from those weeds: Ovatus crataegarious Walker, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Hyalopterus pruni Geoffroy (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Rophalosiphum madis Fitch, and 'others aphid' species were collected. The highest number of aphids were collected in E. cicutarium, followed by S. dulcamara, L. serriola, S. altissimum, and C. album. In laboratory studies, PVY-infected C. album does not induce the production of aphids. Moreover, M. persicae did not appear to have a strong preference for either healthy or PVY-infected potato plant, but they did develop a preference for infected plants after prolonged feeding. M. persicae and M. euphorbiae transmitted PVY from C. album to S. tuberosum, 44 and 37.5 % of the time. Future research should seek to identify not only other sources and prevalence of PVY in the field but vector relationships. In insect-pathogen complex continues to persist in solanaceous field crops around the world.},

This study focus that the responses of seeds or seedling to plant extract is not only or entirely by allelopathy the possibilities also exist that the extract may also exert negative osmotic effect. Results showed that germination percentage was not affected by osmotic pressure as compared to weed extract. However, the radicle elongation of both species was significantly reduced in similar concentration of weed extract. Generally the aqueous extracts were more effective in inhibition of seed germination, radicle growth and percent inhibition in radicle growth as compared to the mannitol solution. Results suggested that aqueous extract of C. album had an allelopathic effect on wheat and chick pea and osmotic pressure play little effect as C. album is concerned.},

  Abstract = {Although the effects of cold stratification on the release of physiological dormancy in seeds have been studied extensively, knowledge of the role of soil moisture content on seed dormancy release during cold stratification is limited. Our study determined seed dormancy characteristics and the effect of soil moisture content on seed dormancy breakage during cold stratification in the five common weed species Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, Chenopodium hybridum, Plantago lanceolata and Setaria glauca. Seeds of all five species were dormant at the time of harvest and their germination response to light and temperature varied. Soil moisture content had a significant effect on seed dormancy release of all species except P. lanceolata. Germination percentage of A. retroflexus, C. album, C. hybridum increased and then decreased as soil moisture content increased, regardless of germination test temperature. The optimal soil moisture content and seed moisture content for dormancy breakage of A. retroflexus, C. album, C. hybridum were 8%, 12%, 8% and 22.0%, 37.7%, 25.7% respectively. Dry storage (after-ripening) significantly increased germination of S. glauca. Moreover, increasing soil moisture content first slowed and then increased dormancy breakage in S. glauca. These results suggest that data on soil moisture content should be incorporated into models that predict weed seed dormancy breakage and timing of seedling emergence as well as those for weed management.},

  Abstract = {Incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil has been suggested as a means for reducing weed seedbanks. To explore this hypothesis, we buried mesh bags of seeds mixed with sand at 15-cm depth in late fall in plots that had been planted with rye (Secale cereale L.) or hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) or left unplanted. Separate bags contained either velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.), Powell amaranth (Amaranthus powellii S. Watson), or common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.). The experiment used a randomized complete block design with five replications, and enough bags were buried to allow a final recovery in each of the following three springs. Each spring, bags were exhumed, and seeds were either counted and tested for viability or mixed with chopped cover crop material or simply stirred for control bags, and the material was reburied. The experiment was completed twice with initial burials in fall of 2011 and 2013. Rye had no consistent effect on persistence of seeds of any of the species. For two observation intervals, rye increased persistence of a species; for another two intervals, it decreased persistence relative to the control; but mostly rye did not affect persistence. Hairy vetch decreased persistence of C. album and A. powellii in both runs of the experiment but had no effect on persistence of A. theophrasti and S. faberi. Germination of the first two species is promoted by nitrate, whereas A. theophrasti germination is not sensitive to nitrate, and S. faberi is only rarely nitrate sensitive. We suggest that nitrate released during decomposition of hairy vetch may have promoted fatal germination of C. album and A. powellii. Incorporation of legume cover crops like hairy vetch may provide a means for decreasing the seedbanks of the many weed species whose germination is promoted by nitrate. The lack of any reduction of A. theophrasti and S. faberi seed persistence in response to hairy vetch and the inconsistent and mostly negligible effect of rye indicate that a general increase in readily decomposable organic matter through incorporation of cover crops may be ineffective at reducing weed seedbanks.},

  Abstract = {In the last decade, the prevalence of Atriplex patula as a weed in the Belgian sugar beet area has increased. Possible reasons for its expansion in sugar beet fields, besides a poor implementation of the low-dose phenmedipham/activator/soil-acting herbicide (FAR) system, might be low sensitivity or evolved resistance to one or more herbicides used in sugar beet. Dose–response pot bioassays were conducted in the glasshouse to evaluate the effectiveness of five foliar-applied sugar beet herbicides (metamitron, phenmedipham, desmedipham, ethofumesate and triallate) and three pre-plant-incorporated herbicides (metamitron, lenacil, dimethenamid-P) for controlling five Belgian A. patula populations. Local metamitron-susceptible and metamitron-resistant populations of Chenopodium album were used as reference populations. Effective dosages and resistance indices were calculated. DNA sequence analysis of the photosystem II psbA gene was performed on putative resistant A. patula populations. Overall, A. patula exhibited large intraspecific variation in herbicide sensitivity. In general, A. patula populations were less susceptible to phenmedipham, desmedipham, ethofumesate and triallate relative to C. album populations. Two A. patula populations bear the leucine-218 to valine mutation on the chloroplast psbA gene conferring low level to high level cross-resistance to the photosystem II inhibitors phenmedipham, desmedipham, metamitron and lenacil. In order to avoid insufficient A. patula control and further spread, seedlings should preferentially be treated with FAR mixtures containing higher-than-standard doses of metamitron and phenmedipham/desmedipham and no later than the cotyledon stage.},

Knowledge of leaf optical properties and factors affecting them is important in understanding of the impacts of red/far-red ratio in agroecosystems. Effects of leaf position on the plant stem on their optical properties at 660 and 730 nm were studied in tomato and two weeds Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus. Leaf position on stem strongly influenced leaf optical properties. Reflectance and transmittance were generally lower for the C. album and A. retroflexus leaves at higher positions on the stem, except for reflectance at 730 nm in C. album, which did not change. Reflectance was not affected in tomato. Transmittance generally decreased for leaves at higher positions. Red/far-red ratios of reflected (Rratio) and transmitted (Tratio) light generally decreased in all species, except Rratio in tomato, where it increased slightly at higher positions. These effects were greater in A. retroflexus compared with C. album and tomato. Changes in these ratios were partly explained by chlorophyll content and leaf mass per area. The results show that leaf position on plant stem influences leaf optical properties in tomato and two weeds and this effect differed between species. These influences and the differences among species could modify red/far-red ratios in canopies comprising these species, which could influence their growth and inter-plant interactions.},

The screening test of these weeds was carried out in laboratory on filter paper, soil and agar by three solvent extracts (viz., aqueous, hexane and methanolic) and sandwich method. The methanolic L. camara extract significantly suppressed germination percentage of E. helioscopia, P. minor R. dentatus and A. fatua measuring at 65%, 63%, 61% and 60%, respectively. Likewise, L. camara significantly suppressed radical length of A. fatua, P. minor and C. album with 54%, 53% and 52%, respectively compared to the control. Besides, plumule length of E. helioscopia, C. album, R. dentatus and A. fatua was also inhibited at 56%, 55%, 53% and 53%, respectively by L. camara methanolic extract. It can be concluded that L. camara methanolic extract significantly reduced seed germination, radical and plumule length of selected weeds and have potential to be used in further detailed evaluation for searching bioherbicide from this plant.},

  Abstract = {Experiments to evaluate 40% and 80% methanol extracts prepared from the aboveground parts of two Solanum nigrum biotypes and from the roots of two Avena sativa biotypes were used to test the growth and development of some weed species and agropathogens. The species collected from different crop fields were Viola arvensis, Chenopodium album, Stellaria media, Papaver rhoeas, and Thlaspi arvense together with the pathogenic fungi Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, and F. oxysporum. Plant morphological changes and significant fresh weight reduction of Viola arvensis were observed when treated with both 40% and 80% extracts. A similar response was found in C. album, but only when plants were treated with an 80% extract obtained from plants of S. nigrum collected from a maize field. The most susceptible to both extracts from A. fatua roots growing in a spring wheat field were C. album and S. media, whereas V. arvensis was only susceptible to the 80% extract. The addition of the extracts obtained from A. fatua to PDA medium at concentrations of 0.1% and 1% contributed to significant reductions in the mycelium growth of all three Fusarium species. The extract obtained from S. nigrum added to PDA medium at 1% concentration slightly stimulated mycelium growth of F. oxysporum.},

  Abstract = {While it is acknowledged that invasive species are a global driver of land degradation, their effects are often only noticed when the invasion has been going on for a while. However, early stage processes must play a fundamental role in plant establishment until invasive plants are able to outgrow the native vegetation. In ten plots of 100 m2 each, we tested the hypothesis that belowground properties are associated with early invasion processes aboveground. We examined the early stage of invasion by a woody legume (Acacia longifolia), growing in the canopy of native dune shrubs (Corema album) as a model system in oligotrophic primary dunes in southern Portugal. Biomass under canopies of invaded and non-invaded C. album shrubs as well as organic matter (OM) distribution in various soil fractions was measured. In accordance with our hypothesis, A. longifolia presence was related to increased C. album foliar d15N, a proxy for nitrogen derived from the invasive legume. Under invaded canopies, root and rhizosphere biomass were higher, as was OM in the silt-clay fraction. Also, d15N of the OM in the silt-clay fraction under invaded canopies was enriched, while d13C was depleted. Finally, we found that the ratio between OM in the biotic versus soil compartment could be a good early indicator for invasion. These findings suggest that even when aboveground invasion pressure on the system is low, it is imperative for ecosystem conservation to remove young plants, as they might alter soil functioning already at an early stage of invasion.

  Abstract = {Salt stress is one of the most dramatic abiotic stresses that induce oxidative and osmotic stress simultaneously. Salt stress is known to be more effective in reducing growth and yield of glycophytes; however, halophytes are able to withstand salt stress. Nonetheless, variability exists among different halophytic plants species from different plant families. Chenopodium album belongs to Chenopodiacea family and is known as weed in many regions of world; however, it is a very interesting halophytic plant. Little research has conducted so far by considering C. album as model plant to study salt stress tolerance mechanisms. This article attempts to compile current literature in order to explain C. album salt stress tolerance mechanism and to highlight the knowledge gap relating to salt stress tolerance mechanism in C. album. Briefly, C. album has remarkable ability of seed dimorphism, sodium exclusion, and potassium retention. C. album further tolerates salt stress by increasing redox potential associated with high production of osmolytes and antioxidants.},

  Abstract = {Oligotrophic ecosystems, previously considered to be more resilient to invasive plants, are now recognised to be highly vulnerable to invasions. In these systems, woody legumes show belowground ecosystem engineering characteristics that enable invasion, however, the underlying processes are not well understood. Using a Portuguese primary dune ecosystem as an oligotrophic model system, belowground biomass pools, turnover rates and stoichiometry of a native (Stauracanthus spectabilis) and an invasive legume (Acacia longifolia) were compared and related to changes in the foliage of the surrounding native (Corema album) vegetation. We hypothesized that the invasive legume requires less phosphorus per unit of biomass produced and exhibits an enhanced nutrient turnover compared to the native vegetation, which could drive invasion by inducing a systemic N/P imbalance. Compared with the native legumes, A. longifolia plants had larger canopies, higher SOM levels and lower tissue P concentrations. These attributes were strongly related to legume influence as measured by increased foliar N content and less depleted d15N signatures in the surrounding C. album vegetation. Furthermore, higher root N concentration and increased nutrient turnover in the rhizosphere of the invader were associated with depleted foliar P in C. album. Our results emphasize that while A. longifolia itself maintains an efficient phosphorus use in biomass production, at the same time it exerts a strong impact on the N/P balance of the native system. Moreover, this study highlights the engineering of a belowground structure of roots and rhizosphere as a crucial driver for invasion, due to its central role in nutrient turnover. These findings provide new evidence that, under nutrient-limited conditions, considering co-limitation and nutrient cycling in oligotrophic systems is essential to understand the engineering character of invasive woody legumes.},

  Abstract = {The competitive ability of five prominent weeds species that have the potential to interact in soybean cropping systems of Argentina (Amaranthus quitensis, Chenopodium album, Digitaria sanguinalis, Setaria verticillata and Tagetes minuta) was evaluated in two greenhouse experiments (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). Crop and weeds were grown in all pairwise mixtures using an additive competition design. Competitive ability was evaluated through competitive indices based on species total biomass. Both experiments showed asymmetric competitive interactions between species, resulting in a competitive network predominantly transitive involving up to four from six species in Exp. 1: Glycine.max > C. album > D. sanguinalis > (A. quitensis, S. verticillata and T. minuta) and up to three from six species in two pathways in Exp. 2: G. max > D. sanguinalis > (C. album, S. verticillata and T. minuta); and G. max > A. quitensis > (C. album, S. verticillata and T. minuta). The hierarchical relationship between species found in this study has implications on weed population dynamics in the context of community assembly framework. We discuss engineered management practices that consider the use of the crop and weed competitive ability to modulate the community structure and the rationalization in the use of herbicides directed to avoid environmental damage.},

  Abstract = {Tank mixed application of herbicides with adjuvant is required for effective weed management and to reduce herbicide load on agricultural crops. Field studies were conducted to investigate the effect of herbicides at reduced rates with adjuvant on common goosefoot (Chenopodium album) and field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis) and grain yield of wheat for two consecutive winter seasons. Treatments included post-emergence foliar application of four herbicides viz., fluroxypyr + tribenuron-methyl + clopyralid, mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl sodium, bromoxynil + MCPA, iodosulfuron-methyl sodium (pre mixed formulations) at their recommended rates 244.5, 14.2, 444.6, 10 g a.i. ha-1, respectively and 25% reduced rates with alkyl ether sulfate Na salt at 400 mL ha-1 as adjuvant. A weedy check was kept as control. All the herbicide treatments caused a significant reduction in densities (up to 85% and 89.2%) of C. arvensis and C. album, respectively and total dry weight (12.4-56%), N (3.7-50%), P (25-63.6%) and K (1.4-56.6%) uptakes from weedy check. Better weed control was achieved with 25% lower dose of all herbicides along with adjuvant in comparison with that recorded with their full doses without adjuvant. All herbicide treatments increased the grain yield of wheat ranging from 10.4 6-56.1% over control during both years. Herbicides with adjuvant produced significantly the higher grain yield of wheat than those observed with herbicides alone. Among all herbicide treatments, 75% doses of bromoxynil + MCPA and iodosulfuron-methyl sodium along with alkyl ether sulfate adjuvant were proved to be the best as they gave significantly the higher (4902.3 and 5159.0 kg ha-1 and 4566.5 and 4891.0 kgha-1) grain yields of wheat during years 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively.},

  Abstract = {Antioxidant defence responses were evaluated in Chenopodium album plants treated with a mixture of the phytotoxins ascaulitoxin, 2,4,7-triamino-5-hydroxyoctandioic acid (ascaulitoxin aglycone) and trans-4-aminoproline, produced by the pathogenic fungus Ascochyta caulina, previously proposed as mycoherbicide for this noxious weed. The enzymatic and non-enzymatic effects of these phytotoxins on the ascorbate system and on catalase activity were assessed by evaluating their biological and specific activities through spectrophotometric and electrophoretic analyses. In addition, the oxidative status was monitored through evaluating H2O2 content during the time-course. The mixture of toxins induced high levels of H2O2 accumulation resulting in an oxidative burst in the plant cells. Ascorbate peroxidase and catalase had crucial roles in detoxifying H2O2. The persisting metabolic perturbations, however, led to severe necrosis and death of C. album plants. The induced H2O2 production may be generated by the fungus as part of its necrotrophic nature. This study explains the defence responses in C. album to the mycoherbicide, in particular, the ascorbate systems' components and H2O2 as an index of oxidative stress.},

We examined the inhibitory influence of 11 cover crop mulches on the germination and growth of weed species (Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Chenopodium album L. and Matricaria chamomilla L.) in laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments. In the laboratory, cover crop extracts were tested in germination bioassays at six concentrations (0–500 mg ml-1). The germination rate and root length (i) were measured 10 days after treatment (DAT). Pot experiments were carried out in the greenhouse to investigate the effects of cover crop mulch (ii) incorporated into the soil on weed germination and weed dry mass. Field trials measured the suppressive effects of cover crops and cover crop mixtures on weeds (iii). Correlations were determined between the experiments to quantify the competition and the biochemical effects of cover crops separately. Cover crop extracts at a concentration of 125 mg ml-1 (i) significantly reduced the weed germination rate by 47% and the root length by 32% on average. M. chamomilla showed a lower susceptibility to the extracts of S. alba, R. sativus var. niger and H. annuus compared to C. album and S. media. The mulch-soil mixtures (ii) significantly reduced the germination rate by 50% and the dry mass by 47% on average across all three weed species, while M. chamomilla showed the highest tolerance to the mulches of V. sativa and A. strigosa. The correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between extract toxicity and field weed suppression and, thus, indicated a high impact of the biochemical effects of the tested cover crops on weed suppression, especially for S. media and M. chamomilla.},

As a result of liming during the period 1976–2005, average soil pH levels at the start of the sixth crop rotation (2001–2005) ranged from 4.1 (unlimed) to 6.6. And in each pH plot were four sub-plots with a different amount of mobile phosphorus:potassium. In acid soil (pH 4.1), in spring oilseed rape and in spring barley crops, the dominant weed Spergula arvensis density decreased significantly at a pH of 5.1 or higher. With increasing amount of P2O5:K2O in soil, the abundance of S. arvensis in spring rape and spring barley crops was reduced at all soil pH levels. At pH 5.1, Chenopodium album and Tripleurospermum perforatum were prominent. Elytrigia repens tended to decrease with increased alkalinity and nutrient amount in soil. With reduction of soil acidity from pH 4.1 to 6.6, the total weed infestation consistently declined in all crops. A low amount of P2O5:K2O in soil caused the decline in the abundance of S. arvensis, E. repens and increase in C. album and T. perforatum.},

  Abstract = {Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) is implicated in tomato yellows disease in many countries worldwide. It has a wide host range, including cultivated species as well as arable weeds, and it is transmitted in a semiper-sistent manner by at least five whitefly species or biotypes of the genera Trialeurodes and Bemisia. ToCV is not seed transmitted and more than 36 weed species have been recorded as natural reservoirs, acting as unique sources both for the virus and its vectors when susceptible crops are harvested. In this study, experiments were conducted to determine the transmission parameters of ToCV by biotype Q, the most abundant biotype of Bemisia tabaci in Greece. Results showed that biotype Q is an efficient vector of ToCV and it is able to retain the virus for at least 6 days. This vector was then used for the evaluation of four widespread weed species (Solanum nigrum, Sonchus oleraceus, Amaranthus retroflexus, and Chenopodium album) as ToCV sources through transmission experiments. Solanum nigrum was shown to be the most significant viral source among the tested weeds, followed by Sonchus oleraceus, A. retroflexus, and, lastly, C. album. Nevertheless, none of them was as efficient a ToCV source as tomato. This variation could be attributed to differences in virus concentration in each plant species or possible host preference by the whitefly vector.},

  Abstract = {Atrazine-resistant weeds are well known, and the resistance is primarily caused by a point mutation in the psbA chloroplast gene encoding the photosystem II D1 protein. Heteroplasmy, the presence of different types of chloroplasts in an individual plant, is also very common. Thus, atrazine-resistant weeds may also partly possess the atrazine-binding sequence and vice versa. The region of the psbA gene containing the mutation was sequenced from atrazine-resistant and atrazine-sensitive Chenopodium album and Senecio vulgaris plants. In atrazine-sensitive C. album plants, the expected AGT triplet was found. The atrazine-resistant plants contained the expected base substitution (AGT to GGT); however, in addition the AGT triplet was found. The atrazine-resistant S. vulgaris plants contained the expected GGT sequence, whereas the atrazine-sensitive plants contained both the AGT and GGT sequences. This clearly indicates that in addition to Gly264 also Ser264 is present in atrazine-resistant plants, and vice versa in atrazine-sensitive plants, indicating heteroplasmy in these weeds.},

  Abstract = {The effects of water extracts of Chenopodium album leaves and roots on the growth of grass weed (Setaria viridis) and broad leaf weed (Corchorus olitorius) grown with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) in greenhouse pots were studied in the National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt. In this experiment fresh leaf and root extracts and their corresponding dry leaf and root extracts at different concentrations were used. There were significant inhibitions in the dry weights of S. viridis and C. olitorius by all extracts at the flowering stage of beans and at harvest. The inhibition effect of all C. album extracts on both weeds (dry weight/pot) depended on the extracted plant organ (leaf or root), its fresh or dry form as well as its concentrations. The inhibition caused by the leaf extract was much higher on weed growth than that of root extract. A higher concentration of fresh leaf extract (25%) had the highest significant inhibition effect. The results also indicated that C. olitorius was more sensitive to the extracts than S. viridis. On the other hand, the inhibition effect of the extracts on the growth of both weeds was accompanied by increased bean growth and yield/plant. The analysis of both leaf and root extracts of C. album revealed that the total content of polyphenols and flavonoids in the leaf extract was more than triple that of the root extract. The results suggested that the fresh leaf extract of C. album may be a possible tool for the development of weed control using natural herbicides.},

  Abstract = {Weed management in field crops is based on threshold levels. Direct yield reductions by weeds can be quantified, but indirect effects by serving as alternate hosts of plant–parasitic nematodes are more difficult to assess. In Germany, intensive cultivation of sugar beet in 3-year rotations with cereals provides long fallow periods between harvest and planting of the following crop. Weeds developing during this period could serve as hosts of Heterodera schachtii, the sugar beet cyst nematode. In previous studies, only limited nematode population density effects were detected during the stubble period. Physiology and population characteristics of the potential host plants may impact reproduction potential of H. schachtii. In a microplot experiment, reproduction of H. schachtii was measured under Capsella bursa-pastoris, Chenopodium album and Thlaspi arvense, and compared to that under susceptible Beta vulgaris during the vegetation period from spring to late summer. There was no difference in population density of H. schachtii on the weed species, but all were much lower than under B. vulgaris. In a greenhouse study, the reproduction of H. schachtii on nine populations of C. album from different regions of Germany was compared to that on each of a susceptible and resistant cultivar of B. vulgaris and Raphanus sativus. All C. album populations supported lower reproduction (<2 %) than the susceptible sugar beet and oilseed radish. Lower nematode population density and negligible reproductive potential on a diverse selection of C. album support the hypothesis that the risk of H. schachtii population buildup under these weeds is limited.},

  Abstract = {The objective of this research was to compare selected ecophysiological parameters for a wheat crop found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of India and its five dominant weeds. The dominant and regionally ubiquitous weeds in the wheat field that was selected for the study were Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, Melilotus albus, Phalaris minor and Rumex dentatus. Taller weeds, such as C.album and P.minor, constituted one group along with the crop, with a low photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen mass basis, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and leaf area ratio, in comparison to shorter weeds, such as A.arvensis, M.albus and R.dentatus, which formed another group with a high photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen mass basis, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and leaf area ratio. Interspecific variations in the photosynthetic rate were driven mainly by variability in the specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content. The taller weeds and the crop had a low specific leaf area later in the season, whereas the smaller weeds had a relatively high specific leaf area, which might be an adaptation to the shaded environment below the canopy. The result indicates that any weed management in the wheat fields of the Indo-Gangetic Plains will need two different approaches because of the different strategies followed by the two weed groups that were identified in the present study.},

The weed flora at site were Chenopodium murale, C. album, Anagallis arvensis, Convolvulus arvensis, Melilotus indica, Spergulla arvensis, Malva parviflora, Fumaria parviflora, Rumex obtusifolius and Coronopus didymus among broadleaf weeds and Phalaris minor in grassy weed. The experiment consisted of eight herbicide (weedy check, 2,4-D at 500 g ha-1, triasulfuron at 15 g ha-1, carfentrazone at 20 g ha-1, isoproturon at 750 g ha-1, 2,4-D + isoproturon at 500 + 750 g ha-1, triasulfuron + isoproturon at 15 + 750 g ha-1, carfentrazone + isoproturon at 20 + 750 g ha-1) and three phosphorus sources (DAP, SSP and PROM) making twenty four treatment combinations. These treatments were evaluated in randomized block design with four replications. Amongst the weed control treatments tank mixture of carfentrazone + isoproturon (20 + 750 g ha-1) resulted in complete elimination of all the broadleaf weeds except Convolvulus arvensis. Isoproturon and its tank mixture with other reduced weed density and dry matter of Phalaris minor significantly than weedy check and rest of the treatments. Tank mix application of herbicides tended to reduce weed dry matter significantly in comparison to singly applied herbicides, however, carfentrazone + isoproturon resulted in minimum weed dry matter (11.29 kg ha-1) and highest weed control efficiency (97.33%). Consequently, it produced significantly higher grain (5816 kg ha-1) and straw (8904 kg ha-1) yields and net returns ( 65267 ha-1) compared to other treatments. This mixture recorded significantly lower N, P and K uptake by weeds with concomitant 84.9, 119.5 and 73.3 % higher uptake of these nutrient elements by wheat crop over weedy check.},

Field experiments were conducted at Institute of Agriculture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry (55º23' N, 23º51' E) during the period 2010–2012 on a loamy Endocalcari-Epihypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-p-w-can) to determine the influence of tank-mixed herbicides phenmedipham + desmedipham + ethofumesate (136.5 + 106.5 + 168 g ha-1 a.i.) with chloridazon (624 g ha-1 a.i.), metamitron (700 g ha-1 a.i.) and triflusulfuron (3.75 g ha-1 a.i.) on broad leaf weeds. Phenmedipham + desmedipham + ethofumesate was applied at three doses, 1/1, 2/3 and 1/2 of the recommended dose. Metamitron was applied at two doses, 1/1 and 1/2 of the recommended dose. All herbicide combinations acted similarly in reducing these weed species: Chenopodium album, Thlaspi arvense, Tripleurospermum perforatum, Polygonum aviculare, Viola arvensis, Veronica arvensis, Lamium purpureum, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Euphorbia helioscopia. The efficacy of phenmedipham + desmedipham + ethofumesate at full (1/1) dose was similar to that applied in a tank mix with chloridazon, metamitron and triflusulfuron at full dose. There were no significant differences in weed weight. Having reduced the dose of phenmedipham + desmedipham + ethofumesate by 33% and 50% in a tank mix, the dry weight of C. album, T. perforatum and P. aviculare increased not significantly. The addition of chloridazon, metamitron and triflusulfuron at full dose had a similar impact on weeds. The action of triflusulfuron was longer because the weight of dominant weeds (C. Album and T. perforatum) decreased (6–37%) during all crop growing period. Reducing the dose of metamitron from 525 to 350 g ha<sup>-1</sup> a.i. (33%) in a tank mix with phenmedipfam + desmedipham + ethofumesate at 1/2 dose, the dry weight of C. album, T. perforatum, P. aviculare, V. arvensis and C. bursa-pastoris increased not significantly. By reducing the dose of herbicides in a tank mix, the number of active ingredients (a.i.) should be increased.},

  Abstract = {It is necessary to elucidate its growth mechanism in order to prevent and control the further spread of Flaveria bidentis, an invasive plant in China. The effects of shading (shading rate of 0, 50% and 80%, respectively) and planting pattern (single cropping of F. bidentis, single cropping of Chenopodium album and their intercropping) on germination rate, fluorescence characteristics and growth characteristics of the two plants were investigated. The results showed that moderate shading contributed to emergence rate, but emergence rate of F. bidentis was not uniform, which was one of important factors as a stronger invader. With the increasing light intensity, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), photochemical quenching (qP), electron transport rate of PSII(ETR), quantum yield of PSII(Y), non-photochemical quenching (qN), water use efficiency (WUE), shoot biomass rate (SMR), crown width (CW) and dry biomass (DM) increased, specific leaf area (SLA) decreased, LMR of F. bidentis significantly increased, LMR of C. album changed insignificantly, and the increment of DM of F. bidentis was higher than that of C. album. In 80% shade treatment, Pn and DM of F. bidentis were lower than those of C. album. In natural light treatment, Pn, qN, WUE and relative competitive index (RCI) were the highest, CW and DM of intercropped F. bi-dentis and Pn, Y of C. album were significantly lower than that of the respective single treatment. F. bidentis had higher light saturation point (LSP) and light compensation point (LCP). In conclusion, the shade-tolerant ability of F. bidentis was weaker than that of C. album, but it was reversed in natural light treatment. The two plants adapted to the weak light in 80% shade treatment by increasing SLA and decreasing LMR. F. bidentis improved competition under natural light by increasing SMR and decreasing CW.},

  Abstract = {Plant nutrition is one of the most important intensification factors of crop production. The utilization of nutrients, however, may be modified by a number of production factors, including weed presence. Thus, the knowledge of occurring weed species, their abundance, nutrient and water uptake is extremely important to establish an appropriate basis for the evaluation of their risks or negative effects on crops. That is why investigations were carried out in a long-term fertilization experiment on the influence of different nutrient supplies (Ø, PK, NK, NPK) on weed flora in maize field.The weed surveys recorded similar diversity on the experimental area: the species of A. artemisiifolia, S. halepense and D. stramonium were dominant, but C. album and C. hybridum were also common. These species and H. annuus were the most abundant weeds.Based on the totalized and average data of all treatments, density followed the same tendency in the experimental years. It was the highest in the PK treated and untreated plots, and significantly exceeded the values of NK fertilized areas. Presumably the better N availability promoted the development of nitrophilic weeds, while the mortality of other small species increased.Winter wheat and maize forecrops had no visible influence on the diversity and the intensity of weediness. On the contrary, there were consistent differences in the density of certain weed species in accordance to the applied nutrients. A. artemisiifolia was present in the largest number in the untreated control and PK fertilized plots. The density of S. halepense and H. annuus was also significantly higher in the control areas. The number of their individuals was smaller in those plots where N containing fertilizers were used. Contrary to them, the density of D. stramonium, C. album and C. hybridum was the highest in the NPK treatments.},

  Abstract = {Summary: Chenopodium album became a problem weed in sugar beet production, due to resistance to metamitron, a key herbicide in this crop. Dispersal of the seeds from resistant biotypes may occur due to spread by wind, animals, agricultural machinery or manure. This study examined the effect of ensiling, digestion by cattle and storage in slurry and farmyard manure on the germination and viability of the seeds of one susceptible and three resistant C. album populations. After 4 weeks in a maize silo, seed viability of C. album populations was reduced drastically to 0-5%. Incubation for 24 h in the rumen followed by a post-ruminal digestion in vitro of intact seeds only resulted in a small reduction in viability in one C. album population. Storage in a slurry cellar for 16 weeks reduced the viability of intact seeds of the C. album populations to 25-60%. Only 0-1% of the seeds remained viable after storage in a farmyard manure heap for 4 weeks. An accelerated ageing experiment showed seed persistence to be population specific and less related to seed weight. Keeping a fresh maize silo closed for at least 4 weeks and heaping farmyard manure are excellent preventive measures to limit the spread of resistant C. album seeds between fields. © 2013 European Weed Research Society.},

  Abstract = {This study was carried out to compare the diversity in seed production and the soil seed bank in a dryland and an irrigated agroecosystem in the dry tropics. Both agroecosystems showed a comparable number of species, but only 25% and 38% similarity during the winter and rainy cropping seasons, respectively. In the irrigated agroecosystem, the amount of seed production diversity was almost double in the winter season, compared to the rainy season. The weed seedbank diversity was low but was sensitive to cropping practices and seasons in both agroecosystems. A considerably smaller soil seedbank size in the irrigated agroecosystem (cf. dryland) was related to lowered weed seed production. The dryland agroecosystem showed a greater accumulation of the seeds of broad-leaved weeds, whereas the irrigated agroecosystem accumulated more seeds of the grasses or sedges. About three-fourths of the seeds during the winter season were accounted for by Anagallis arvensis and Chenopodium album in the dryland agroecosystem and by C.album and Melilotus indica in the irrigated agroecosystem. However, during the rainy season, Ammannia baccifera, Echinochloa colona and Cyperus rotundus dominated in both agroecosystems. The changes in the weed seed bank and its diversity are mainly attributed to differences in water management, which tends to reduce species diversity, especially at a lower depth, but leads to the dominance of some potentially noxious weeds (e.g. Phalaris minor and M.indica). Approximately double the soil seedbank size and a greater diversity at a lower depth might indicate an adaptive mechanism in the storage of weed seeds in the dryland agroecosystem. © 2013 Weed Science Society of Japan.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance of Chenopodium album to triazinones and triazines can be caused by two amino acid exchanges, serine-264-glycine (Ser264Gly) and alanine-251-valine (Ala251Val), in the chloroplast D1 protein. This paper describes the identification of a biotype with a leucine-218-valine (Leu218Val) switch found in German sugar beet fields with unsatisfactory weed control. A greenhouse experiment has been performed to compare the resistance profile of the newly identified biotype with biotypes that carry the Ser264Gly and Ala251Val mutations. RESULTS: Application rate-response curves obtained from the greenhouse experiment showed that the Leu218Val exchange induced significant resistance against the triazinones but not against terbuthylazine. The level of resistance against the triazinones was higher in the Ser264Gly and Ala251Val biotypes compared with the Leu218Val biotype. All biotypes tested were more resistant to metribuzin than to metamitron. Following terbuthylazine treatment, Ser264Gly displayed a high level of resistance, Ala251Val showed moderate resistance. A PCR-RFLP assay for Ser264Gly has been extended to include detection of Ala251Val and Leu218Val mutations. CONCLUSION: The D1 Leu218Val substitution in C. album confers significant resistance to triazinones. This suggests that Leu218Val is involved in the binding of triazinones. First establishment of the resistance profiles of the three psbA mutations suggests that these mutations have been independently selected. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.},

  Abstract = {Enhanced understanding of soil disturbance effects on weed seedling recruitment will help guide improved management approaches. Field experiments were conducted at 16 site-years at 10 research farms across Europe and North America to (i) quantify superficial soil disturbance (SSD) effects on Chenopodium album emergence and (ii) clarify adaptive emergence behaviour in frequently disturbed environments. Each site-year contained factorial combinations of two seed populations (local and common, with the common population studied at all site-years) and six SSD timings [0, 50, 100, 150, 200 day-degrees (d°C, base temperature 3°C) after first emergence from undisturbed soil]. Analytical units in this study were emergence flushes. Flush magnitudes (maximum weekly emergence per count flush) and flush frequencies (flushes year-1) were compared between disturbed and undisturbed seedbanks. One year after burial, SSD promoted seedling emergence relative to undisturbed seedbanks by increasing flush magnitude rather than increasing flush frequency. Two years after burial, SSD promoted emergence through increased flush magnitude and flush frequency. The promotional effects of SSD on emergence were strongest within 500 d°C following SSD; however, low levels of SSD-induced emergence were detected as late as 3000 d°C following SSD. Accordingly, stale seedbed practices that eliminate weed seedlings should occur within 500 d°C of disturbance, because few seedlings emerge after this time. However, implementation of stale seedbed practices will probably cause slight increases in weed population densities throughout the year. Compared with the common population, local populations exhibited reduced variance in total emergence measured within sites and across SSD treatments, suggesting that C. album adaptation to local pedo-climatic conditions involves increased consistency in SSD-induced emergence.

  Abstract = {The aim of this work was to compare herbicide efficacy and reduction of weed reproduction after the application of three frequently used soil residual herbicides during pre-emergent (PRE) and early post-emergent (EPOST) application in maize. Plot field trials were carried out in Central Bohemia during two growing seasons (2010 and 2011). Good efficacy (88%, resp. 83%) was found in isoxaflutole + thiencarbazone (ISF + THC) and terbuthylazin +S-metolachlor (TBA + SMC) on Echinochloa crus-galli, especially in PRE application use. Efficacy on Amaranthus retroflexus was 91% at both tested application periods and there were no significant differences between experimental years. Significant differences in A. retroflexus control were recorded among all tested herbicides (ISF +THC > TBA + SMC > pendimethalin (PEM) + dimethenamid (DMA)). No significant differences between PRE and EPOST were recorded in efficacy on Chenopodium album. Significant differences in efficacy on C. album were recorded among all tested herbicides (ISF + THC > TBA + SMC > PEM + DMA). Mercurialis annua was the most tolerant tested weed, which was significantly better controlled at EPOST herbicide application (73%) compared to PRE application (32%). TBA + SMC showed a significantly higher efficacy on M. annua compared with other tested herbicides. Seed production of all tested weeds was strongly effected by weather conditions, which were significant during 2011, when there was higher than average precipitation during May and June. The most seeds were produced by A. retroflexus > C. album > E. crus-galli > M. annua. ISF + THC best reduced seed production of E. crus-galli, A. retroflexus and C. album, especially when applied at PRE. TBA + SMC best reduced seed production ofM. annua. Weed competition on untreated control plots caused yield loss by 90%and 47% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, compared to treatments with the highest yield (ISF + THC).},

  Abstract = {Field experiments designed to explore weediness of hemp crops of industrial varieties were carried out at the Upyte Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry in 2010-2012. Eight monoecious industrial hemp varieties from France (5), Poland (2) and Ukraine (1) were grown in a conventional crop rotation after winter wheat. Hemp was sown at a seed rate of 50 kg ha-1with 10 cm interrows at the beginning of May and harvested when the first matured seeds appeared. No mechanical or chemical weed control was applied during hemp growth period. Density of weeds at full hemp emergence was relatively high, with the highest average value of 202 plants m-2in 2011, the year with relatively high air temperatures at the end of May-beginning of June and adequate rainfall. At hemp harvesting, the highest weed density and above-ground biomass was found in 2010, the year characterised by high temperatures in July and August, in the plots of the USO 31, the variety with the shortest growth period and the lowest plant height. A total of 31 weed species were identified in hemp experiments-26 species of broad-leaf and grass weeds and 5 species of perennial weeds. At full hemp emergence, weeds typical of spring crops of the region were most abundant: Chenopodium album L. dominated in 2010, Veronica arvensis L. in 2011, while in 2012 the domination was shared by the four weed species Lamium purpureum L., Thlaspi arvense L., V. arvensis and Poa annua L. At harvest, in total 8 weed species were found; however, only C. album and partly Polygonum aviculare L. were relatively abundant in all years.},

  Abstract = {The area of degraded forests in Vietnam is substantial, currently about 3.1 million ha of which about 1.7 million ha (55 %) were granted to individual farms for reforestation. However, the result of farmers' reforestation efforts is limited. We aimed to examine the financial return, technical efficiency, and factors determining reforestation with a native tree species (Canarium album) by farms. Our results showed that reforestation with C. album is less financially profitable than that with an exotic tree species (Acacia mangium) as the alternative land use option. The subsidy from the government is found insufficient to compensate for the income losses of farmers participating in reforestation with the native tree species. Reforestation with C. album could be more successful if participating farmers were equipped to be more technically efficient. Finally, our findings clearly showed that the security of forest land property rights and the provision of forest extension services are among the determinants of participation in, and the subsequent success of reforestation with C. album. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album L. is a problematic weed in many crops. Information on seedling emergence characteristics is necessary to optimize the timing of weed control operations. Seedling emergence pattern was studied during two years with seeds of C. album buried at soil depths of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 cm in outdoor pots. According to the measurements, the mean daily soil temperature was similar at all depths, whereas fluctuation in temperature was higher at the soil surface and decreased with depths. Seedlings emerged from all depths over extended period of time from mid February to mid May. Total numbers of emerged seedlings was higher for seeds placed at the soil surface, possibly due to the stimulatory effect of light and daily fluctuation in temperature on germination, and decreased with depth. However, seedling emergence surprisingly increased again in seeds buried at the depth of 10 cm with a main flush in late March and few sporadic emergences before and after this time. This information can be used to predict seedling emergence behavior in different soil depths and therefore use in management of C. album in agriculture © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

  Abstract = {Summary: Some farming practices, like organic farming, lead to greater numbers of weed plants in crop fields. These fields may give us some insights into any benefits that may be gained from biodiversity (e.g. improved pest control services) and allow us to understand the mechanisms behind crop-weed interactions. The influence of two common weeds, lamb's-quarters Chenopodium album and charlock Sinapis arvensis, on performance of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi in spring-sown barley Hordeum vulgare is evaluated in three field experiments. Observations in field experiments indicated that the presence of S. arvensis reduced aphid population development in the barley crop significantly, but this effect was not observed in barley grown with C. album. Observed effects in the field were further studied in laboratory experiments with regard to aphid growth and reproductive performance. Above- and below-ground interactions of S. arvensis and C. album with barley were tested using twin-exposure cages. Aphid performance was negatively affected when barley plants had root contact with S. arvensis. The results of these laboratory experiments showed a difference in mode of action of the two weeds. Synthesis and applications. The results support the potential of associated resistance, mediated by neighbouring plants, in minimizing herbivore damage of focal plants and highlighted the mechanism by which herbivores might be affected. Since chemical exchange between plant neighbours can potentially occur in any plant community, increased understanding could be valuable for existing and new agroecosystems, invasion biology and sustainable crop production. To get a balance between herbicide and insecticide control, agricultural production systems need to focus on the thresholds of weed and insect tolerance, taking the associated resistance of biodiversity (here weeds) into account. Agricultural biodiversity may provide many long-term benefits over monoculture, from reducing pesticide pollution to preventing insecticide resistance. Our study is an important step forward in general understanding of the effects of vegetational diversity on herbivore population dynamics.

  Abstract = {Aim of our study was to exploit the relation between deposit structure at the microscale and the uptake and biological efficacy of herbicides. For this purpose, we analysed the relevance of the deposit structure of diquat dibromide, as affected by surfactants, on the spatially resolved chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) and the desiccation of the leaves. The present study is a sequential work to our studies with the systemic compound glyphosate. On that basis, we hypothesized here that larger deposits of diquat are negatively related to the bio-efficacy of the compound. By using selected ethoxylated rapeseed oil adjuvants (RSO 5, RSO 10, RSO 30, RSO 60) we influenced the deposit properties of diquat dibromide droplet residue on the leaves of easy-to-wet Viola arvensis and the difficult-to-wet Chenopodium album species. With the spatially-resolved pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) ChlF technique we demonstrated the effect of diquat on the physiology of the tissue. As shown, the RSO surfactants did not affect the area of diquat residue on the easy-to-wet leaves of V. arvensis; this trend is similar to those observed for ChlF and the herbicide desiccation potential. In contrary, on C. album, decreased deposit area of diquat droplet was associated with increased effect on ChlF parameters and increased desiccation potential of the herbicide, thus explaining its higher foliar uptake. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Two assays were done with leaf litter of U. pumila from riverine ecosystems (i). the effects of aqueous litter extracts in Petri dish assays and (ii). the effect of litter residues in pot experiments. The leaf litter extracts inhibited the radicle growth of D. glomerata and T. repens but did not effect the germination. However in pots, leaf litter inhibited the germination speed of C. album and growth of D. glomerata and T. repens. Our results showed the allelopathic potential of U. pumila litter, which reduced the growth of understory species (T. repens and D. glomerata).

  Abstract = {Treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 µM hydroxamic acids F1 and F2, found previously to inhibit carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase enzyme CCD1, was found to cause chlorophyll bleaching and phytotoxicity. A further set of hydroxamic acid analogues was synthesised, and these compounds were found to be phytotoxic towards A. thaliana at 16-400 µM, and to show some phytoxicity towards broad-leaved weeds C. album and S. media at 100 µM. Compound F1 was found to inhibit p-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), a known herbicide target (IC50 30 µM), but compounds F5 and F8 showed no inhibition of HPPD, despite F8 showing higher levels of phytotoxicity. Plants grown in the presence of F1 or F5 that were treated with 50 µM homogentisic acid showed partial recovery of growth, indicating some inhibition of HPPD in planta. These are the first hydroxamic acid inhibitors reported for HPPD, but the results indicate that inhibition of HPPD is only partly responsible for the observed phytotoxicity, and that another unknown metalloenzyme is also targeted by these compounds. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

  Abstract = {Field experiments were conducted over 2 years to determine the influence of timing, rate, and method of application of mesotrione on weed control, forage sorghum injury, and fresh weight biomass. Sucrosorgo 506 sorghum was treated with 120 and 80 g ha-1 of mesotrione with petroleum oil (PO) or methylated seed oil (MSO) plus 28% N urea-ammonium nitrate liquid fertilizer (UAN). Mesotrione was applied once between the 4- and 6-leaf stages of sorghum or split and applied between the 2- and 3-leaf and the 6- and 7-leaf stages in 2 equal applications, with or without adjuvants. Mesotrione at 120 g ha-1 effectively controlled all weed species, except Geranium pusillum. At 80 g ha-1 it effectively controlled Chenopodium album, Polygonum convolvulus, and Polygonum aviculare, and at the 80 g ha-1 split application (40 + 40 g ha-1) it effectively controlled P. convolvulus and P. aviculare. Both PO and MSO, added to the spray liquid containing mesotrione at 80 g ha-1, made it possible to effectively eliminate weeds; a split application with PO effectively reduced the occurrence of C. album, Brassica napus, Thlaspi arvense, P. convolvulus, and P. aviculare, and application with MSO reduced the occurrence of C. album, P. convolvulus, and P. aviculare. Mesotrione at 120 and 80 g ha-1 as a single application and at an 80 g ha-1 split application did not cause injury to sorghum plants. The addition of PO or MSO adjuvant to 80 g ha-1 of mesotrione applied at a single rate caused slight injury to sorghum plants, which quickly recovered. No injury or slight symptoms were found after a few weeks on sorghum plants treated with a mesotrione at 80 g ha-1 split with PO and MSO. The addition of UAN to the spray mixture apart from mesotrione and PO and MSO, inhibited growth and chlorosis on the leaves. The rate of 80 g of mesotrione with adjuvants is recommended for forage sorghum. © TÜBITAK.},

All the fungal culture filtrates also suppressed root/shoot growth of wheat; however, the effect was less intense as compared to the effect against the two weed species. In foliar spray bioassays, the effect of original culture filtrates was studied on the growth of 1-week and 2-weeks old weeds and wheat plants. Culture filtrate of D. hawaiiensis significantly reduced the shoot and root biomass of 1-week old plants of C. album. Similarly, the culture filtrates of D. biseptata and D. australiensis significantly suppressed shoot biomass of both 1-week and 2-weeks old A. fatua plants. None of the fungal culture filtrates exhibited significant effect on shoot and root biomass of wheat in foliar spray bioassays.},

There was a noticeable inter- and intraspecies variability in pathogenicity towards wheat and maize. Isolates of F. solani from Sonchus arvensis and F. verticillioides from C. album were highly pathogenic to wheat seedlings and apathogenic to maize seedlings. Isolates of F. venenatum were very pathogenic to wheat and maize being the first report about pathogenicity of this species. This experiment proves that weeds and plant debris can serve as alternate hosts and source of inoculum of plant pathogens.},

Agria) to ethalfluralin, trifluralin, pendimethalin, rimsulfuron, EPTC and oxadiargyl applied pre-emergence (PRE) and post-emergence (POST) at seven rates. The experiments showed that trifluralin applied PRE, rimsulfuron applied PRE or POST and oxadiargyl applied POST provided the best control of A. retroflexus. Rimsulfuron and oxadiargyl applied POST and pendimethalin applied PRE were the best control options for C. album. Except for trifluralin and pendimethalin the susceptibility of the two weed species to the herbicides was similar. Trifluralin was more effective against A. retroflexus than C. album while the opposite was true for pendimethalin. Applied POST oxadiargyl was more effective than applied PRE. In contrast no differences were observed between PRE and POST applications for metribuzin, rimsulfuron and EPTC. Crop injury to rimsulfuron applied PRE or POST, trifluralin and pendimethalin was negligible while the other herbicides injured the potato crop. Metribuzin, oxadiargyl and ethalfluralin tended to cause more damage than EPTC. The results suggest that rimsulfuron and trifluralin would be the best options for weed control of A. retroflexus and C. album in Iranian potato fields. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Sixteen treatment combinations were tested in RBD with three replications. Results revealed that the criss-cross was found the best in respect of growth attributes viz., seedling/m2, shoot desnsity/m2 at maximum tillering stage, ear density/m2 at complete emergence and unproductively tillers/m2 at maturity. While the plant height at all stages, leaf area index of wheat and CGR at tillering stage with the applying the furrow raised bed systems were observed significantly more.

  Abstract = {Common lambsquarters is highly competitive in many cropping systems and has demonstrated resistance to several herbicide mechanisms of action. However, predicting the spread of resistance is difficult due to limited information about gene flow. We conducted research to determine the potential for movement of resistance alleles in common lambsquarters under field conditions. Chenopodium giganteum (a member of the C. album aggregate) that has a dominant magenta phenotypic marker was used as a pollen parent in gene flow experiments. A wild-type accession of common lambsquarters was used as a seed parent. Seed parents were grown in a soybean field and arranged in concentric circles 2 to 15 m from a center which contained 24 pollen parents. The concentric circles were divided into eight directions. Pollen movement was estimated by determining the percentage of progeny with the magenta phenotype from seed parents. Average cross-pollination across directions was greatest (3.0) at 2 m and decreased to low levels (0.16) 15 m from the center, consistent with observations of other primarily self-pollinated species. Cross-pollination was greatest (P<0.10) in the south-southwest, west-southwest, and west-northwest directions, approximately 180° from the prevailing wind direction during the time of pollen shed. Since common lambsquarters does not have an active dispersal mechanism for seeds, pollen-mediated gene flow may play an important role in the transfer and frequency of resistance alleles within and between populations.

  Abstract = {Tracing spread of weeds with molecular markers can give valuable information on the importance of migration mechanisms. This study investigated the local spread of metamitron-resistant Chenopodium album patches in the west of the province West Flanders (Belgium) using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. During the summer of 2009, leaf samples of C. album plants were harvested in 27 patches, distributed over 10 sugar beet fields and one maize field. The fields were grouped in four local clusters, each corresponding to a farmer who cultivated these fields. A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence procedure identified the Ser 264 to Gly mutation in the D1 protein, endowing resistance to metamitron, a key herbicide applied in sugar beet. The majority of the sampled plants within a patch (97% on average) carried this mutation. Genetic variation among the four farmers' locations (12%) and among the C. album patches within the farmers' locations (14%) was significant according to amova (P<0.001). In addition, Mantel tests confirmed a positive correlation between genetic distance (linearised f{cyrillic} PT between pairs of patches) and the logarithm of geographic distance for the complete data set (Mantel coefficient significant at P=0.001), suggesting isolation by distance. Nevertheless, genetic similarity between patches from different fields indicated that seed transport by agricultural machinery and manure is likely to have an important impact on the spread of metamitron-resistant biotypes. Farmers should become aware of the resistance problem as soon as possible, in order to prevent further spread in their fields. © 2012 European Weed Research Society.},

To study its possible use as a natural herbicide, the oil was tested invitro against Amaranthus hybridus, Portulaca oleracea, Chenopodium album, Conyza canadensis and Parietaria judaica, completely inhibiting A. hybridus germination, and nearly blocking C. canadensis and P. judaica germination at all concentrations assayed. In P. oleracea, the oil showed less effect, inhibiting its germination at the higher doses studied. It did not control C. album germination. Regarding seedling length, the oil had strong phytotoxic activity, being effective at all concentrations tested. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

Chenopodium album L. is a documented host for PVY and naturally infected plants have been reported in Europe. Natural infections of PVY have not been reported from C. album in North America to date. C. album grows in abundance in and around potato fields in New Brunswick, Canada. To investigate whether this species can be a natural host for PVY and, moreover, be a potential inoculum source for this virus, we investigated its ability to be infected naturally with PVY in the wild and under controlled inoculations. PVY was not detected in 164 C. album leaf samples collected from potato fields in the potato growing area in New Brunswick in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. We inoculated field-grown C. album plants with plant sap from PVY infected plants and Myzus persicae Sulzer fed on infected plants. PVY was detected from 16% of the sap inoculated plants 4 weeks after inoculations but not from the aphid inoculated plants. Altogether, these results indicate that C. album does not play a significant role as a host for PVY in this region. © 2012 Potato Association of America.},

  Abstract = {Rising atmospheric [CO 2] is predicted to affect C 3 and C 4 weed interference with crop species differently, with C 3 weeds benefiting more from elevated [CO 2] (eCO 2) than C 4 species. Our aim was to quantify impacts of eCO 2 on C 3 and C 4 weeds at three levels of biological organisation: individual, population and community. We conducted a field study in 2007 and 2008 within the SoyFACE experiment in Champaign, Illinois, USA, in which Amaranthus rudis (C 4) and Chenopodium album (C 3) were grown with soyabean. This is a Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Elevated [CO 2] influenced weeds at all levels of biological organisation. However, community-level impacts were largest. Interference by A. rudis and C. album with soyabean was 37% and 11% lower, respectively, in eCO 2. In residual weed communities under ambient [CO 2] (aCO 2), C 3 and C 4 species were equally likely to dominate the community, whereas in eCO 2, there was a 90% chance of community dominance by C 3 species. Future investigations of weed ecology and global change under FACE conditions may improve their inference space by including sources of environmental stress such as ozone, heat and drought. 2012.

In this experiment, six rotations (R1-R6) were considered, basically consisting on the same crop sequence with different starting points, i.e. (1) legume crop (soybean/field bean/common pea), (2) vegetable crop (pepper/melon), (3) winter cereal (soft/durum wheat), (4) summer cereal (maize) (5) industrial vegetable (processing tomato), (6) winter cereal (soft/durum wheat). All rotations were established both in ORG and in CONV, in strict adherence to EU regulations (ORG: EU reg. 2092/91; CONV: EU reg. 2078/92). Intercrops with green manuring purposes were included in ORG, while weed control was performed mechanically in ORG and chemically/mechanically in CONV. Weed seedbank was determined on 10 soil samples (0-0.30. m depth) in each plot and seeds were directly extracted, identified and counted. In all rotations, the adoption of ORG resulted in a significant increase in weed seedbank density, particularly in the case of summer weed species (Portulaca oleracea L., Amaranthus retroflexus L. and Chenopodium album L.), which are more competitive and difficult to control in summer crops under organic farming systems in the Mediterranean climates. Small differences between ORG and CONV were found in terms of number of weed species (23 in ORG and 20 in CONV, on average), but the index of diversity in CONV was on average higher than in ORG. Furthermore, the most dominant weeds in CONV represented a lower percentage of total seedbank (40%, 23% and 5%, respectively, for P. oleracea, A. retroflexus and C. album in CONV and 56%, 32% and 4% for the same three weeds in ORG). These results confirm that the wider availability of effective weed control methods in integrated low-input farming systems (CONV) is helpful to maintain a low seedbank size, with a lower dominance structure. However, the adoption of ORG systems based on long rotation cycles, very competitive crops and accurate weed control, especially at the beginning of the ORG management, may be sustainable in the long run, in terms of potential weed infestation levels. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract = {Aims: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses affect plant competitive relationships within and among species and may be involved in the interactions among agricultural weed species and crops, depending on their mycorrhizal status. In this work, the impact of native AM fungi (AMF) on maize-weed(s) and weed-weed competitive relationships was assessed, using Solanum nigrum and Chenopodium album as model host and non-host weeds, respectively. Methods: Growth performance, nutrient use and competitive ability of crop and weed species were assessed in the pure stand and in different model plant communities of host and non-host species. Results: Results showed that maize performance decrease was more severe when grown with C. album than with S. nigrum. Differential responses to AMF occurred in the two weed species tested: mycorrhizal S. nigrum showed reduced biomass and N uptake when grown in competition with C. album. The negative performances observed when mycorrhizal S. nigrum grew in competition with C. album corresponded to C. album larger biomass production and N uptake. Conclusions: Results showed that AMF are able to alter the competitive relationships between co-occurring plant species differing in their mycorrhizal status (host/non-host), thus representing key soil organisms to be taken into account in sustainable weed management strategies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  Abstract = {Outdoor pot experiments and field experiments were conducted to examine the influence of nitrogen rate on herbicide efficacy. Growth of unsprayed Tripleurospermum inodorum increased with increasing nitrogen rate in pot experiments; increasing nitrogen also increased the susceptibility to tribenuron-methyl. An increased susceptibility at high nitrogen rate was also observed for Anagallis arvensis, but in contrast to T. inodorum, growth of unsprayed A. arvensis was unaffected by nitrogen rate. Growth of unsprayed Chenopodium album was also promoted by nitrogen supply. However, no influence of nitrogen rate on herbicide efficacy was evident for C. album with tribenuron-methyl or ioxynil+bromoxynil in pot experiments. Field experiments with tribenuron-methyl were conducted on natural populations of C. album in spring barley grown at different nitrogen rates showed similar results. In conclusion, nitrogen rate affected herbicide efficacy for some but not all combinations of weed species and herbicide. Decreased herbicide efficacy was only observed at very low nitrogen rates. The results suggest that the effect of nitrogen rates on herbicide efficacy will be marginal in intensive farming systems with high nitrogen supply, but in low intensity systems, weed patchiness might increase. © 2012 The Authors.

  Abstract = {Background: In recent years, common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) populations from sugar beet fields in different European countries have responded as resistant to the as-triazinone metamitron. The populations have been found to have the same D1 point mutation as known for atrazine-resistant biotypes (Ser 264 to Gly). However, pot experiments revealed that metamitron resistance is not as clear-cut as observed with triazine resistance in the past. The objectives of this study were to clarify the absorption, translocation and metabolic fate of metamitron in C. album. Results: Root absorption and foliar absorption experiments showed minor differences in absorption, translocation and metabolism of metamitron between the susceptible and resistant C. album populations. A rapid metabolism in the C. album populations was observed when metamitron was absorbed by the roots. The primary products of metamitron metabolism were identified as deamino-metamitron and metamitron-N-glucoside. PABA, known to inhibit the deamination of metribuzin, did not alter the metabolism of metamitron, and nor did the cytochrome P450 inhibitor PBO. However, inhibition of metamitron metabolism in the presence of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor ABT was demonstrated. Conclusion: Metamitron metabolism in C. album may act as a basic tolerance mechanism, which can be important in circumstances favouring this degradation pathway. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album L. is a major weed in spring-planted crops in the temperate regions of the world. Since 2000, farmers have reported an unsatisfactory control of this weed in sugar beet fields in Belgium, France and The Netherlands. Frequently, the surviving C. album plants are resistant to metamitron, a key herbicide in this crop. Metamitron resistance in C. album is caused by a Ser264 to Gly mutation in the psbA gene on the chloroplast genome, which prevents binding of metamitron to its target site. This mutation causes also resistance to other herbicides with a similar mode of action, like metribuzin -applied in potato- and atrazine in particular. Atrazine has been applied very frequently in maize in the 1970s and the 1980s, but is now banned in Europe due to environmental reasons. The persistent use of atrazine in maize confronted Belgian and other European farmers in the early 1980s with atrazine resistant C. album with the same Ser264 to Gly mutation. The problems with atrazine resistant C. album disappeared when other herbicides were applied in maize. Unfortunately, this is not the case for metamitron resistant C. album in sugar beet, because no replacement herbicide is readily available. The history of atrazine use in maize brought up a question concerning the origin of the current metamitron resistant C. album populations. Have these populations been selected locally by regular use of metamitron in sugar beet or did the selection occur earlier by atrazine use when maize was grown in the same fields? This would have serious implications regarding the reversibility of herbicide resistance. Therefore, soil samples were collected on 16 fields with different histories: five fields with an organic management over 25 years, two fields with a history of atrazine resistant C. album, five fields with metamitron resistant C. album in sugar beet and four fields which were under permanent grassland for 10 years, preceded by a regular rotation in which sugar beet was a key crop. The seeds of C. album were extracted from the soil and germinated on a germination table. Germinated seeds were allowed to grow in a growth chamber. Metamitron resistance was determined by a chlorophyll fluorescence test and leaf material was sampled for AFLP-analysis. For all fields, estimations were made of the size of the seed bank (i.e. an indirect estimate of population size), the frequency of resistant plants and the genetic diversity of resistant and susceptible populations. The results indicate that herbicide-resistant C. album populations are persistent and maintain their adaptive capacity, challenging future management of metamitron resistant C. album.},

  Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to study the influence of organic (ORGFYM - organic with green and cattle manure, ORGGRM - organic with green manure) and conventional (CONFYM - with green manure, cattle manure, mineral fertilizers and pesticides) treatments on weed species diversity, their abundance and biomass. A total of 44 weed species/taxa were encountered during the study covering a period of 2007-2011. In the ORGGRM, the number of weed species was 39 (24 annuals and 15 perennials), in the ORGFYM - 36 (21 annuals, 1 biennial and 14 perennials) and in the CONFYM treatment - 30 (19 annuals, 1 biennial and 10 perennials). Centaurea cyanus, Cerastium arvense, Geranium pratense, Myosurus minimus, Polygonum laphatifolia, Plantago lanceolata and Plantago major were found only in ORGGRM treatment. The average number of species per 0.25 m2 was 9.2 and 9.3 in the organic treatments and 4.9 in the conventional treatment. The average values of Shannon diversity index were statistically higher in the organic (ORGGRM - 1.70, ORGFYM - 1.65) than in the CONFYM (1.06; p < 0.05) treatments. Chenopodium album was the most common annual species in all treatments. We found that herbicide application in the CONFYM treatment decreased the density of the most sensitive species (e.g., C. album, Polygonum convolvulus, Mentha arvensis, Polygonum persicaria, Elytrigia repens) but had a minor or no effect on the proportion of herbicide-tolerant species (especially Viola arvensis, Veronica spp., Myosotis arvensis). Among the perennials E. repens was the most common species in all treatments. The highest number of these plants occurred in the ORGGRM treatment. We found that the species pool was larger and the average number of species higher in the organic than in the conventional treatment. No significant difference was identified between the organic treatments. Our results suggest that weed species diversity could be promoted by using organic cropping practices.},

  Abstract = {A recent greenhouse study revealed a significant reduction of germination and growth of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea) by rye mulch, whereas velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album) were not suppressed. Since BOA detoxification by metabolic alteration may influence the relation between the benzoxazinoid content of the soil mulch and weed suppression, we tested the dynamics in BOA detoxification in different plant organs of three and 10-day-old seedlings of four warm season weeds incubated with five BOA concentrations (4, 20, 40, 80, and 200 µmol g-1 fresh weight). In addition, germination and length of 3-day-old seedlings were measured after exposure to 0, 0. 3, 1. 5, 3, 6, and 15 µmol BOA. Finally, we tested the influence of the MDR translocator inhibitors verapamil, nifedipine, and the GST inhibitor ethycrynic acid on BOA accumulation and detoxification activity. Due to BOA-detoxification, all weeds were able to grow in environments with low BOA contents. At higher contents, Abutilon theophrasti and Chenopodium album had a better chance to survive because of highly active mechanisms that avoided the uptake of BOA (A. theophrasti) and of efficient detoxification activities in youngest seedlings (C. album). The interpretation of all of the data gave the following sequence of increasing sensitivity: A. theophrasti <<< C. album << P. oleracea = A. retroflexus. The results were in agreement with recent findings of the suppression of these weeds by rye mulches and their benzoxazinoid contents. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the detoxification of BOA influences the survival of certain weeds in environments enriched with this allelochemical. Therefore, detoxification processes affect the potential for weed suppression by soil allelochemicals in sustainable weed management. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The aqueous extracts inhibited the seed germination and root growth of Chenopodium album, Sinapis alba, Echinochloa crus-galli weeds. C. album and S. alba weeds were most sensitive to all aqueous extracts, while E. crus-galli was most tolerant. In pot experiments, plant residues caused stronger inhibition in shoot than in roots. The phytotoxicity followed the order: A. arborescens > E. rigida > C. nepeta ˜ H. hircinum. These results might help in developing the natural Mediterranean plant extracts for weeds control.},

  Abstract = {Saflufenacil is a new herbicide being developed by BASF for broadleaved weed control in maize, soybean and other crops prior to crop emergence. Six field studies were conducted in Ontario, Canada over a three year period (2008-2010) to evaluate the potential of saflufenacil applied pre-emergence (PRE) at various doses for broadleaved weed control in oats. Saflufenacil applied PRE caused minimal visible injury at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after emergence (WAE) in oats. At 4 WAE, the dose of saflufenacil required to provide 95% control of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters), Polygonum convolvulus (wild buckwheat), Polygonum scabrum (green smartweed) and Sinapsis arvensis (wild mustard) was 72 to >100, >100, 74, 58 and >100 g ai ha-1, respectively. Generally, similar saflufenacil dose-response trends were seen at 8 WAE. The doses of saflufenacil required to provide 95% reduction in density and dry weight ranged from 95 to >100 and 42 to >100 g ai ha-1 respectively for A. artemisiifolia, C. album, P. convolvulus, P. scabrum and S. arvensis. Oat yield showed no sensitivity to saflufenacil at the doses evaluated. Based on this study, saflufenacil applied PRE can be safely used in spring planted oats for the control of some troublesome annual broadleaved weeds. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract = {Chemical control of plant-parasitic nematodes, essentially, involves the use of synthetic nematicides. However, apart from its very high cost, increased concern for the environment has necessitated a reduction in the amount of nematicide used for nematode control. Additionally, there has been an increase in the intensity of search for other efficient, ecologically sound and safe control methods. Meloidogyne incognita. (Kofoid and White) Chitwood, eggs were exposed to concentrations of leaf extracts of agricultural weeds such as Parthenium hysterophorus, 0icotiana plumbaginifolia, Avena fatua, Chenopodium album, Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium murale, Amaranathus spinosus, Oxalis corniculata. One hundred percent concentration of root extracts of P. hysterophorus, 0. plumbaginifolia exhibited 100% inhibition of egg hatch and larval mortality. While 100% concentration of root extracts of A. fatua, C. album exhibited 97.83 and 96.52% inhibition of egg hatch and 95 % larval mortality in both plants at 48 hour. Other plants also exhibited the nematicidal properties. Egg inhibition and larval mortality decreased with an increase in the dilution of all the extracts. Similarly with an increase in exposure time, juvenile mortality was also increased.},

  Abstract = {Thermal stability of antioxidant defense enzymes was investigated in leaf and inflorescence of heat adaptive weed Chenopodium album. Leaf samples were taken at early and late seedling stage in December (LD, 20 °C/4 °C) and March (LM, 31 °C/14 °C). Young inflorescence (INF) was sampled at flowering in April (40 °C/21 °C). LD, LM and INF crude protein extracts were subjected to elevated temperatures (5 to 100 °C) for 30'. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was the most heat stable enzyme followed by Ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Two heat stable SOD isozymes were visible on native-PAGE at 100 °C in both leaf and INF. Some heat stable APX isozymes were more abundant in INF than leaf. Thermostability of catalase (CAT) increased with age and increasing ambient temperatures in leaves. CAT activity was observed up to 60 °C in leaves and INF while peroxidase (POX) retained activity up to 100 °C in INF due to one thermostable isozyme. Glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) showed activity up to 70 °C in both leaves and INF. DHAR activity was stable up to 60 °C while GR and MDHAR declined sharply after 40 °C. Constitutive heat stable isozymes of SOD and APX in leaves and INF may contribute towards heat tolerance in C. album. © 2011 Prof. H.S. Srivastava Foundation for Science and Society.},

  Abstract = {A survey of weeds in spring-sown oilseed crops (Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera and Brassica napus ssp. oleifera) was conducted in southern and central Finland during 2007-2009, representing the first such extensive investigation in the country. The occurrence of the most abundant weed species in oilseeds was surveyed in 429 fields. In the fields with moderate or high weed infestation, 1-6 harmful weed species were recorded by visual observation according to their biomass production. About 40 weed species were recorded, the most predominant being Chenopodium album, Galeopsis spp., Galium spurium, Sonchus arvensis and Tripleurospermum inodorum. Elymus repens was the only major grass weed. Chemical weed control of broad-leaved weeds had been practised in 53% of the fields, resulting in relatively good control. In addition, both selective graminicides and glyphosate were used to control E. repens. Mechanical weed control was not practised in any field. The crop yield level was about 300 kg ha -1 higher in the fields with low weed infestation compared with in the highly infested fields. New promising options to replace the banned herbicide trifluralin are available. Thus, the most harmful weeds, such as C. album, which interferes with the production of high-quality oil for human consumption, can still be effectively controlled. © Agricultural and Food Science.},

  Abstract = {The weed flora in conventionally and organically grown spring cereals was investigated in southern and central Finland during 2007-2009. The survey was conducted in 16 regions, 283 farms and 595 fields (72 organically cropped and 523 conventionally cropped fields, of which 503 were treated with herbicides). The occurrence of weeds was assessed in late July-early August. Altogether 148 weed species were identified, of which 128 were broad-leaved and 20 grass species. In organically cropped fields, the average species number per field was 21 and the most frequent species were Chenopodium album 96%, Stellaria media 94%, Viola arvensis 94% and Elymus repens 89%. In conventionally cropped fields, the average species number was 12 and the most frequent weed species were Viola arvensis 83%, Stellaria media 65%, Galeopsis spp. 59% and Galium spurium 59%. The average density of weeds was 160 m -2 (median = 112) in sprayed conventional fields and 519 m -2 (468) in organic fields. The average air-dry biomass of weeds was 167 kg ha -1 (median = 82) and 775 kg ha -1 (563), respectively. Elymus repens, the most frequent and abundant grass species, produced the highest proportion (about 30%) of the total weed biomass in both cropping systems. The frequency of Galium spurium in conventional cropping and Fumaria officinalis in organic cropping had increased substantially since the previous survey in 1997-1999. The average size of the weed seedbank in the 5 cm surface layer was about 1 700 seeds m -2, the most predominant seeds being of C. album. Although the weed flora in Finnish spring cereal fields consists of numerous species, only a fraction of them severely threaten crop production in terms of their frequency and abundance. Weeds in conventional cropping were effectively controlled with available herbicides whereas weed management in organic cropping calls for urgent measures such as direct mechanical weed control in crop stands, which was not practised at all in survey fields. © Agricultural and Food Science.},

  Abstract = {The bacterial community compositions in Chenopodium album and Stellaria media seeds recovered from soil (soil weed seedbank), from bulk soil, and from seeds harvested from plants grown in the same soils were compared. It was hypothesized that bacterial communities in soil weed seedbanks are distinct from the ones present in bulk soils. For that purpose, bacterial polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprints, made from DNA extracts of different soils and seed fractions, were analyzed by principal component analysis. Bacterial fingerprints from C. album and S. media seeds differed from each other and from soil. Further, it revealed that bacterial fingerprints from soil-recovered and plant-harvested seeds from the same species clustered together. Hence, it was concluded that microbial communities associated with seeds in soil mostly originated from the mother plant and not from soil. In addition, the results indicated that the presence of a weed seedbank in arable soils can increase soil microbial diversity. Thus, a change in species composition or size of the soil weed seedbank, for instance, as a result of a change in crop management, could affect soil microbial diversity. The consequence of increased diversity is yet unknown, but by virtue of identification of dominant bands in PCR-DGGE fingerprints as Lysobacter oryzae (among four other species), it became clear that bacteria potentially antagonizing phytopathogens dominate in C. album seeds in soil. The role of these potential antagonists on weed and crop plant growth was discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Lower concentration of 2% of all the three Chenopodium species enhanced seedling growth of A. fatua. The highest extract concentration of C. album (6%) markedly suppressed both length and biomass of shoot of test weed species.

Three planting patterns considered as main-plot [(including single row spaced 50 cm, single row spaced 60 cm and twin row spaced 60 cm), three times of mechanical control as sub-plot (including mechanical weed control at 4-6, 10-12 and 14-16 leaves stage of sugarbeet) and two herbicides as sub-sub-plot (including metamitron+(phenmedipham +desmedipham+ethofumesat) and triflusulfuron-methil+(phenmedipham+desmedipham +ethofumesat)]. Results indicated significant effects of times of mechanical control and herbicie on weed density and biomass (Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus). In addition, machanical weed control at 4-6 leaves stage of sugarbeet caused the most reduction in biomass of Datura stramonium. Planting pattern had only significant effect on biomass and density of C. album. Furthermore, approximately all of treatments had significant effects on root yield, but approximately other sugarbeet components were not affected by treatments as appropriate as sugar yield. Totally, best results were achieved in metamitron+(phenmedipham+ desmedipham+ethofumesat) and weed control at 4-6 leaves stage that had the most reduction in weeds density and biomass.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album is a weedy annual plant in the genus Chenopodium. C. album pollen represents a predominant allergen source in Iran. The main C. album pollen allergens have been described as Che a 1, Che a 2, and Che a 3. The aim of this work was to clone the Che a 1 in Escherichia coli to establish a system for overproduction of the recombinant Che a 1 (rChe a 1). In order to clone this allergen, the pollens were subjected to RNA extraction. A full-length fragment encoding Che a 1 was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the first-strand cDNA synthesized from extracted RNA. Cloning was carried out by inserting the cDNA into the pET21b (+) vector, thereafter the construct was transformed into E. coli Top10 cells and expression of the protein was induced by IPTG. The rChe a 1 was purified using histidine tag in recombinant protein by means of Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. IgE immunoblotting, ELISA, and inhibition ELISA were done to evaluate IgE binding of the purified protein. In conclusion, the cDNA for the major allergen of the C. album pollen, Che a 1, was successfully cloned and rChe a 1 was purified. Inhibition assays demonstrated allergic subjects sera reacted with rChe a 1 similar to natural Che a 1 in crude extract of C. album pollen. This study is the first report of using the E. coli as a prokaryotic system for Che a 1 cloning and production of rChe a 1. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  Abstract = {A new foliage disease was found on Chenopodium album L. (family chenopodiaceae) in Punjab, Pakistan. Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler was identified and confirmed as the causal agent. The present study aimed to optimize environmental condition that could enhance mycoherbicidal potential of A. alternata against C. album. In growth room trials, the effects of various inoculum concentrations of A. alternata (105, 107 and 109 conidia ml-1) on disease development was studied at different growth stages of the host plant (5 - 10, 10 - 15 and 20 - 25 leaf/flowering stage) at various dew period (100% humidity for 12, 18 and 24 h) and temperature (20, 25 and 30°C) regimes. To enhance the mycoherbicidal potential of the pathogens, different formulations; 1 and 2% gelatin, 1 and 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), 1:1 gelatin and CMC, 10 and 20% canola oil emulsion were used. The pathogenicity of A. alternata increased with increasing spore concentration and length of dew period. A spore concentration of 109 conidia ml-1 in 20% canola oil emulsion with 24 h dew period and at temperature 25 and 30°C caused 100% mortality of C. album plants at 5 - 10 and 10 - 15 leaf stages and resulted in maximum reduction in biomass of the target weed. The present study concludes that under a certain set of conditions, A. alternata can completely control C. album. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

  Abstract = {To evaluate the effects of elevated temperature and CO2 on two annual species of C3 and C4 plants, Chenopodium album (C3) and Setaria viridis (C4), these plants were grown under three different environmental conditions: (1) ambient temperature and CO2 (control), (2) 4°C elevated temperature with ambient CO2 (T4), and (3) combined conditions of 4°C elevated temperature and 1.8 times ambient CO2 (CT4). The plant phonology was generally more affected by increased temperature than elevated CO2 during all growth stages. With a 4°C increase in temperature, the timings of emergence were advanced by approximately 26 days (d) for C. album and approximately 35d for S. viridis. The flowering times were also advanced, by 50d for C. album and by 31.5d for S. viridis. With the advanced phenology observed in the elevated temperature plots, the growth temperatures during the vegetative stage were similar to the values in the control plot. However, the mean temperatures in the elevated temperature plots were significantly higher during the reproductive period than those in the control plot. The biomass and seed weights harvested from C. album were significantly decreased, by 47.3% and 14.6%, respectively, under T4 conditions compared to the control, whereas they were dramatically increased, by 33.9% and 114.4%, respectively, in CT4 conditions compared to the control. The biomass of S. viridis grown under CT4 conditions did not differ significantly from that of the control, although it was slightly increased under T4 conditions. Our results suggest that elevated temperature strongly influences biomass production in annual grasses during the reproductive stage compared to the vegetative growth stage and that these effects may be greater in C3 plants than in C4 plants. However, the disadvantages of warming may be considerably attenuated by elevated CO2, especially for C3 grasses. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract = {Nitrogen fixing plant species are among the most invasive species worldwide. However, field studies directly estimating the differential effect of native versus invasive exotic N2-fixing plants on plant communities are lacking. The exotic leguminous shrub Acacia longifolia invades coastal dunes across Portugal often co-existing with the native N2-fixer Stauracanthus spectabilis. Moreover, this co-existence with native species is possible due to a relatively low cover of Acacia species particularly in the south of Portugal where drought is intense. In this study we compare the impact of two different legume species (native and exotic) on the nitrogen status of a protected Mediterranean dune system. We document how presence of the exotic invader A. longifolia impacted community structure, soil properties and the foliar nitrogen concentrations and growth rates of native species. A. longifolia invaded areas had decreased biodiversity, fewer seedlings and altered soil properties (e.g., increased soil organic matter, NO3- and NH4+). A. longifolia presence was also associated with significant increases in foliar nitrogen content and d15N of the endemic shrub Corema album while presence of the native legume Stauracanthus spectabilis had no discernible impact on C. album. Furthermore, a strong correlation between increased foliar nitrogen and enhanced growth rates in C. album indicate a facilitative effect of A. longifolia on this native shrub. We posit that the combination of nitrogen fixation, a rapid growth rate and production of a thick litter layer result in a very substantial impact of the invader in invaded ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

  Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the mycoherbicidal potential of Alternaria alternata to control Chenopodium album L., a problematic weed of wheat. Two wheat cultivars viz. Inqalab 91 and Punjab 96 were co-cultivated with C. album in 1:1 crop-weed ratio. Mycoherbicidal formulation was prepared in 20% canola oil emulsion with 107conidia mL-1of A. alternata. The mycoherbicidal formulation was sprayed at 2 - 3 and then at 4 - 5 leaf stage of the weed. Application of mycoherbicide significantly reduced the biomass of the target weed species up to 90%. Mycoherbicidal application significantly enhanced number of fertile tillers and 100 grains weight in both wheat cultivars. As a result of mycoherbicidal application, root and shoot biomass was significantly increased in cv. Inqalab 91 but not in cv. Punjab 96. The present study concludes that application of A. alternata in 20% canola oil can reduced growth of C. album resulting in enhanced growth and yield of wheat. © 2010 Academic Journals.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album L. (fat-hen) with a Ser264-Gly mutation is resistant to photosystem II-inhibiting herbicides like the triazinone metamitron, a key herbicide in sugar beet. In recent years, this resistant biotype may cause unsatisfactory weed control in Belgian sugar beet. However, the dimension of the problem was yet unknown. Therefore, a survey was conducted in 2008 covering the whole Belgian sugar beet area. In randomly selected fields, C. album plants surviving weed control were counted and sampled. First, the number of surviving plants was used to estimate the prevalence of fields with unsatisfactory control and to classify the surveyed fields. Then, the share of the resistant biotype in each field was determined with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence-analysis (CAPS-analysis) on sampled leaves. Finally, all results were visualised on the map of Belgium. Twenty percent of the fields had more than 500 surviving plants per hectare and were thus classified as fields with unsatisfactory C. album control. The resistant biotype was present in 95% of these fields and even in 74% of the sampled fields with good weed control. No pattern was found during mapping. These results indicate that the metamitron-resistant biotype has spread over the whole sugar beet area but that it is not (yet) causing severe problems in every field. To get a more accurate estimation of the portion of resistant plants in the field and the effect of herbicide treatment on this biotype, an elaborate survey will be conducted in 2010 on fields that have both untreated and treated plots installed.},

  Abstract = {Sugar beet growers in Europe are more often confronted with an unsatisfactory control of Chenopodium album L. (fat-hen), possibly due to the presence of a triazinone resistant biotype. So far, two mutations on the psbA-gene, i.e. Ser264-Gly and Ala251-Val, are known to cause resistance in C. album to the photosystem II-inhibiting triazinones metamitron, a key herbicide in sugar beet, and metribuzin. The Ser264-Gly biotype, cross-resistant to many other photosystem II-inhibitors like the triazines atrazine and terbuthylazine, is most common. The second resistant C. album biotype, recorded in Sweden, is highly resistant to triazinones but only slightly cross-resistant to terbuthylazine. Since farmers should adapt their weed control strategy when a resistant biotype is present, a quick and cheap detection method is needed. Therefore, through trial and error, a protocol for detection with chlorophyll fluorescence measurements was developed and put to the test. First, C. album leaves were incubated in herbicide solution (i.e. 0 microM, 25 microM metribuzin, 200 microM metamitron or 25 microM terbuthylazine) during three hours under natural light. After 30 minutes of dark adaptation, photosynthesis yield was measured with Pocket PEA (Hansatech Instruments). In Leaves from sensitive C. album, herbicide treatment reduces photosynthesis yield due to inhibition of photosynthesis at photosystem II. This results in a difference of photosynthesis yield between the untreated control and herbicide treatment. Based on the relative photosynthesis yield (as a percentage of untreated), a classification rule was formulated: C. album is classified as sensitive when its relative photosynthesis yield is less than 90%, otherwise it is resistant. While metribuzin, and to a lesser extent, metamitron treatment allowed a quick detection of triazinone resistant C. album, terbuthylazine treatment was able to distinguish the Ser264-Gly from the Ala251-Val biotype. As a final test, 265 plants were classified with the protocol. Simultaneously, a CLeaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS)-analysis was conducted on the same plants to verify the presence of the Ser264-Gly mutation. Only one mismatch was found when results of both detection methods were compared. The test results illustrate that this protocol provides a reliable, quick and cheap alternative for DNA-analysis and bio-assays to detect the triazinone resistant C. album biotypes.},

During the surveys density and frequency of the above mentioned weed species were also determined and number of infected plants was counted in each sampling area. Infected weed samples were collected from each sampling point and brought to the laboratory in polyethylene bags and the pathogens were identified at genus or species level. As a result of two year surveys, ten fungal pathogens were determined on eight weed species. The most important fungal pathogens determined on common weed species were as follow; Peronospora farinosa (Fr.) Fr. on C. album, and Septoria convolvuli DC., Erysiphe convolvuli DC., and Puccinia punctiformis (Strauss) Roehrl. on C. arvensis. These fungal diseases were observed mainly on the weeds located at the borders of fields. Infection rates of these pathogens reached up to 21.2% in some of the survey areas. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these pathogen under in vitro and in vivo conditions.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album L., a salt-tolerant species that is widely distributed in the semi-arid areas of Xinjiang, China, produces numerous dimorphic seeds (black and brown). To investigate the effects of three salts (NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2, which constitute the main salt cations in the soil in semi-arid areas) on seed germination and seedling survival of C. album, seeds were germinated in different salinity treatments: 0, 100, 200, and 250 mmol L-1 of NaCl or KCl; or, 300 and 400 mmol L-1 NaCl or KCl, each amended with CaCl2 (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mmol L-1). Results showed that the brown seeds were more salt tolerant, and a higher percentage germinated than black seeds in the different salinity treatments. The percentage of germinating of black seeds could be significantly improved, when under saline conditions, by the synergetic action of ethephon (C2H6ClO3P) and KNO3. The addition of low concentrations of CaCl2 improved seed germination for seeds exposed to 300 mmol L-1 NaCl or KCl, and the alleviating effects were stronger for the brown than for the black seeds. Seedling survival could also be enhanced by the addtion of CaCl2. These results suggest that the dimorphic seeds of C. album exhibit different germination patterns under different salinity conditions, and that the diversity in salt tolerance of dimorphic seeds enables C. album to adapt to semi-arid areas successfully. The physiological mechanism by which CaCl2 enhances the germination of dimorphic seeds requires further study.},

  Abstract = {Background: Resistance to photosystem II inhibitors - triazines (atrazine) and triazinones (metamitron, metribuzin) - in Chenopodium album L. is caused by the serine 264 to glycine mutation in the D1 protein. This mutation has been detected in C. album collections from Belgium with unsatisfactory metamitron efficacy in the field and was confirmed in greenhouse resistance bioassays. Incomplete herbicide efficacy in practice can also be caused by reduced uptake due to environmental conditions. Hence, for reliable differentiation and resistance identification, a rapid method for mutation detection in the target gene psbA is required. Results: Dose- response curves obtained in herbicide greenhouse assays with metamitron-resistant and -susceptible reference biotypes showed that a dose of 2 L ha-1 metamitron was suitable for discrimination. A psbA PCR-RFLP was developed, based on the presence of a FspBI restriction enzyme recognition site, covering D1 codon 264 in susceptible genotypes. A paper-based DNA extraction allowed direct processing of leaf samples already in the field. In order to detect the mutation even in mixed seed samples, a nested PCR-RFLP was also developed. Conclusion: The method allows exhaustive surveys screening C. album leaf or seed samples for the occurrence of the D1 Ser264Gly mutation to confirm or disprove metamitron resistance in the case of unsatisfactory control. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.},

  Abstract = {Ecologically based weed management relies heavily on a greater integration of cultural and mechanical control tactics than conventional weed management. As such, management outcomes are more dependent on biotic interactions among the crop, weed and methods of management. In this study, we assessed the influence of soil disturbance and cover cropping on the germinable seedbank of Chenopodium album, Abutilon theophrasti and Setaria spp. across a range of initial weed seedbank densities. Cover crop system treatments ranged from greater reliance on tillage at one extreme, to a greater reliance on cover cropping to accomplish weed suppression at the other. In general, seedbank losses to germination were highest when soil disturbance was associated with cover cropping. Of the five cover crop systems (1 year duration), the summer fallow and the yellow mustard/buckwheat. /winter rape mixture consistently decreased the weed seedbank. The magnitude of decline in these high disturbance systems reached complete depletion of the Setaria spp. germinable seedbank and an 85% and 80% reduction for C. album and A. theophrasti respectively. Both systems included tilling the soil three to four times throughout the growing season. In contrast, treatments which involved less soil disturbance had weed escapes that set seed in one or more site years. Cover crop systems that stimulated weed seed germination and where weeds were either suppressed by the cover crop or where subsequent tillage provided control, resulted in the greatest weed seedbank declines. © Published 2010.

  Abstract = {The influence of a non-ionic surfactant (20% isodecyl alcohol ethoxylate plus 0.7% silicone surfactants), an anionic surfactant (25.5% alkylethersulfate sodium salt), and a vegetable oil (95% natural rapeseed oil with 5% compound emulsifiers) on the performance and rainfastness of a new commercial formulation of tribenuron-methyl was assessed on four broad-leaved weeds: wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis), scentless mayweed (Tripleurospermum inodorum), common poppy (Papaver rhoeas), and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album). In one experiment, six doses of tribenuron-methyl alone or in a mixture with each of the three adjuvants were applied to each weed species at two different leaf stages. In another experiment, the plants of T. inodorum were sprayed and subsequently subjected to 3 mm of rain at 1, 2, and 4 h after treatment (HAT). The activity of tribenuron-methyl was significantly enhanced by all the adjuvants on all the weed species and only minor differences were observed among the tested adjuvants. The impact of the adjuvants varied among the weed species and growth stages. The highest response to the inclusion of adjuvants in the spray liquid was found at the late growth stage and on C. album, followed by P. rhoeas and T. inodorum, while S. arvensis was less responsive to the adjuvants. All the adjuvants significantly improved the rainfastness of tribenuron-methyl on T. inodorum, with differences among the adjuvants being more pronounced when rain occurred shortly after herbicide application. The effect of the vegetable oil on tribenuron-methyl's rainfastness was significantly lower than that of the surfactants with rain at 1 HAT, while no significant differences among the three adjuvants were observed when rain occurred at 2 and 4 HAT. © 2010 The Authors.

  Abstract = {Background and Aims: Chenopodium album is well-known as a serious weed and is a salt-tolerant species inhabiting semi-arid and light-saline environments in Xinjiang, China. It produces large amounts of heteromorphic (black and brown) seeds. The primary aims of the present study were to compare the germination characteristics of heteromorphic seeds, the diversity of plant growth and seed proliferation pattern of the resulting plants, and the correlation between NaCl stress and variation of seed heteromorphism. Methods: The phenotypic characters of heteromorphic seeds, e.g. seed morphology, seed mass and total seed protein were determined. The effects of dry storage at room temperature on dormancy behaviour, the germination response of seeds to salinity stress, and the effect of salinity on growth and seed proliferation with plants derived from different seed types were investigated. Key Results: Black and brown seeds differed in seed morphology, mass, total seed protein, dormancy behaviour and salinity tolerance. Brown seeds were large, non-dormant and more salt tolerant, and could germinate rapidly to a high percentage in a wider range of environments; black seeds were salt-sensitive, and a large proportion of seeds were dormant. These characteristics varied between two populations. There was little difference in growth characteristics and seed output of plants produced from the two seed morphs except when plants were subjected to high salinity stress. Plants that suffered higher salinity stress produced more brown (salt-tolerant) seeds.Conclusions: The two seed morphs of C. album exhibited distinct diversity in germination characteristics. There was a significant difference in plant development and seed proliferation pattern from the two types of seeds only when the parent plants were treated with high salinity. In addition, seed heteromorphism of C. album varied between the two populations, and such variation may be attributed, at least in part, to the salinity. © The Author 2010.},

  Abstract = {This study aimed to describe emergence cycles of selected weed species under Central European conditions in relation to cumulative soil temperatures from the start of the vegetation season. Emergence of Chenopodium album, Echinochloa crus-galli, Galinsoga ciliata, and Abutilon theophrasti was observed from March to October during the period 2001-2006 at two locations. The beginning of main field emergence was determined as the day when the sum of effective hour temperatures was achieved, and was detected from the second decade of April to early May for C. album, in the second decade of May for E. crus-galli, from late April to the beginning of May for G. ciliata, and from the end of April to mid-May for A. theophrasti. The relationship between cumulative soil surface layer temperature and weed mass field emergence at the beginning of the growing season is very direct (differences ± 7 days) - but only when soil moisture is sufficient. In a drier spring, the beginning of mass field emergence occurs with 1-4 weeks of delay and field emergence is usually slower and protracted.},

  Abstract = {Two field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of multispecies weed competition on wheat grain yield and to determine their economic threshold on the crop. The experiments were conducted in 2002, on two sites in Iran: at the Agricultural Research Station on Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (E1) and on the fields of Shirvan's Agricultural College (E2). A 15 x 50 m area of a 15 ha wheat field in E1 and a 15 x 50 m area of a 28 ha wheat field in E2 were selected as experimental sites. These areas were managed like other parts of the fields, except for the use of herbicides. At the beginning of the shooting stage, 30 points were randomly selected by dropping a 50 x 50 cm square marker on each site. The weeds present in E1 were: Avena ludoviciana, Chenopodium album, Solanum nigrum, Stellaria holostea, Convolvulus spp., Fumaria spp., Sonchus spp., and Polygonum aviculare. In E2 the weeds were A. ludoviciana, Erysimum sp., P. aviculare, Rapistrum rugosum, C. album, Salsola kali, and Sonchus sp. The data obtained within the sampled squares were submitted to regression equations and weeds densities were calculated in terms of TCL (Total Competitive Load). The regression analysis model indicated that only A. ludoviciana, Convolvulus spp. And C. album, in E1; and A. ludoviciana, S. kali, and R. rugosum, in E2 had a significant effect on the wheat yield reduction. Weed economic thresholds were 5.23 TCL in E1 and 6.16 TCL in E2; which were equivalent to 5 plants m-2 of A. ludoviciana or 12 plants m-2 of Convolvulus spp. Or 19 plants m-2 of C. album in E1; and 6 plants m-2 A. ludoviciana, 13 plants m-2 S. kali and 27 plants m-2 R. rugosum in E2. Simulations of economic weed thresholds using several wheat grain prices and weed control costs allowed a better comparison of the experiments, suggesting that a more competitive crop at location E1 than at E2 was the cause of a lower weed competitive ability at the first location.},

  Abstract = {Five field trials were conducted over a three-year period (2006-2008) at two locations in southwestern Ontario to determine the length of time herbicides can remain in the spray tank prior to application in the field without impacting efficacy. Four pre-emergence and five post-emergence herbicides were mixed at their labelled rates and then applied in maize. Herbicides were either applied immediately after mixing in water, or after being held in solution for 1, 3 or 7 days. The most common weed species in the trials were Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, and Chenopodium album. Holding the herbicides in spray solution for up to 7 days did not affect the efficacy of the post-emergence herbicides in this study. Similarly, control of A. retroflexus and C. album with the pre-emergence herbicides was not affected holding the herbicides in spray solution for up to 7 days. However, control of A. theophrasti was decreased when isoxaflutole plus atrazine, dimethenamid plus dicamba/atrazine, or rimsulfuron plus S-metolachlor plus dicamba was in spray solution for more than 1 day. Nonetheless, there were no decreases in yield for any of the treatments evaluated. These data provide valuable information which growers can use to make informed decisions on whether to apply herbicides in non-ideal weather or to postpone application. The results of this study suggest that for the herbicides and weed species tested it is better to postpone application rather than make applications under non-ideal conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {This research was aimed to investigate the application of weed species for phytoremediation of soil polluted with boron. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effect of increasing boron (B) application on the growth and B uptake of common weed species, Sorghum halepense L. Pers., Cyperus rotundus L., Cynodon dactylon L. Pers., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Echinochloa Cruss-gali L. and Chenopodium album L. Four levels of B (0, 10, 20 and 30 mg kg-1 soil) were applied to six weed species. Results revealed that, shoot and root dry weight of species decreased with increasing B application. There was a considerable variation among weed species in terms of their responses to B applications. The species having rhizomes such as S. halepense, C. rotundus and C. dactylon Pers. were more tolerant to the B toxicity than species growing from the seeds of A. retroflexus, E. Cruss-gali and C. album. The shoots contained higher concentration of B than the roots. Boron content of weed species was notably different and was affected by B applications. The high aboveground biomass and B accumulation in the shoot of any of weed species used in the experiment cannot be considered a potential parameter for the phytoextraction of B. © 2009 Academic Journals.},

  Abstract = {A survey in 2007-08 indicated the presence of 5 weed species belonging to 5 genera and 4 families infesting 13 field and vegetable crops. Among these five weed genotypes, there were two annual weed species (Brachiaria reptans and Chenopodium album) and three perennials including Achyranthes aspera, Rumex dentatus, and Solarium nigrum. All the weeds had distinct Meloidogyne incognita-root galling and egg masses but their number and size varied among the 5 weed genotypes. The 3 genotypes including A. aspera, C. album, and S. nigrum were graded good hosts and B. reptans and R. dentus as poor hosts. Our findings suggest that, in addition to egg stages, weed plants provide a means of survival for nematode populations which may contribute to the maintenance, reinfestation, multiplication and spread of nematodes, within a field, thus increasing the potential for crops to be damaged by nematode attacks. © 2009 Zoological Society of Pakistan.},

  Abstract = {The competition for nutrients between pea plants and four weeds was studied in a pot experiment under greenhouse conditions. The additive experimental method was used, where the density of the crop was constant and that of the weeds varied. In each pot six pea plants of the early-maturing 'Karlos' variety were cultivated. The weeds were wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.B.). Weed competition was examined at three densities: 5, 10 and 15 plants per pot. Weed-free pots containing only pea were used as the control. The plants were grown in pots containing 1.9 kg soil, with 13 treatments and four replications, giving a total of 52 pots. The experimental soil was loamy Ramann brown forest soil (Eutric Cambisol) with the following main characteristics: humus content 2.05% (medium supplies); upper limit of plasticity according to Arany (KA): 39; pH(H2O): 7.26; pH(KCl): 6.48; mineral N content: 24.08 mg/kg; AL-P2O5 content: 241.19 mg/kg (very good supplies); AL-K2O content: 244.24 mg/kg (good supplies). Only the nutrients in the soil were available to the plants (except for the small quantity of atmospheric nitrogen fixed by pea), as no fertilizer was applied. The plants were grown for six weeks after germination, after which the fresh and dry shoot mass of the pea and weed plants was measured. The nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents were determined from dried plant samples after digestion with concentrated sulphuric acid. The main results can be summarized as follows: - Different weed species and their densities influenced the nutrient content of pea to different extents. The growth rate of the weed species was not uniform; S. arvensis developed most rapidly, covering most of the pot surface by the end of the experiment. E. crus-galli also grew well. Poor growth was observed for A. retroflexus and C. album plants, so their nutrient uptake and competitiveness were low. - Weeds generally decreased the nutrient content of green pea due to their intensive nutrient uptake. S. arvensis caused the strongest inhibition in the intensive nutrient uptake of the crop plants. The phosphorus and potassium content of wild mustard were not influenced by its density. - The N, P and K contents of A. retroflexus declined as the density increased, indicative of strong intraspecific competition.},

  Abstract = {Three field experiments were carried out in 2000, 2002 and 2004 in central Italy in order to establish the "minimum dose requirement for a satisfactory efficacy" (ED90 or ED95) of mesotrione against several of the most important weeds in maize. Mesotrione was sprayed at four doses in 2000 (150, 100, 50 and 25 g a.i. ha-1) and 2002 (100, 75, 50 and 25 g a.i. ha-1), and at five doses in 2004 (150, 100, 75, 50 and 25 g a.i. ha-1). Untreated and weed-free plots were always added as checks. For each "year-mesotrione-weed" combination, dose-response curves were used to estimate the dose of mesotrione required to obtain 90 and 95% weed control (ED90 and ED95 values). Mesotrione phytotoxicity to the maize and the crop grain yield were also assessed. ED values showed that several weeds could be satisfactorily controlled with reduced doses of mesotrione. In particular, mesotrione could be used at 1/6 of the maximum labelled dose (150 g a.i. ha-1) in order to obtain 95% of efficacy against Abutilon theophrasti, Chenopodium album, Solanum nigrum and Xanthium strumarium; while Amaranthus retroflexus and Polygonum persicaria could be satisfactorily controlled (95% weed efficacy) with 40-45 g ha-1 of mesotrione (about 1/4 of the maximum labelled dose). This selective triketone herbicide had to be applied at 90 g a.i. ha-1 to obtain a high efficacy (95%) against Echinochloa crus-galli; while it did not prove effective against Portulaca oleracea even at maximum labelled dose. Thus the ranking among weed species based on their sensitivity to mesotrione was: A. theophrasti = C. album = S. nigrum = X. strumarium > A. retroflexus = P. persicaria > E. crus-galli > P. oleracea. Mesotrione showed a good selectivity to the crop at all application doses; however, some phytotoxicity symptoms, in the form of leaf bleaching, were only transitory and dissipated by 4-5 weeks after treatments with no damage to crop yield. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {Weeds within canopies are depleted in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and red to far-red light ratio (R/FR) throughout their lifespan. Growth cabinet studies isolated PPFD and R/FR effects and explored the adaptive traits of a model invasive weed, Chenopodium album, to light and temperature. Reproductive development progressed rapidly at high temperature, yet the rate of leaf appearance was insensitive to temperatures of 25:15 and 10:5°C (day:night). Low R/FR effects were detected early in the life cycle, but by seed set, growth was influenced by low PPFD. C. album adapted to the simulated canopy environments by delaying seed set, growing taller and producing more leaf area per mol of accumulated incident PPFD. Low PPFD reduced seed number per plant and the carbon/nitrogen ratio of those seeds, but not seed weight. PPFD was a primary cue for many shade avoidance traits and only under low PPFD did R/FR modify the expression of these traits. This study elucidates the adaptive strategies that make C. album a persistent weed. © 2008 The Authors.},

Because qualitative and quantitative variation is well documented in sunflower types, we screened three commercially grown varieties of sunflower (Hybrid Supper-25, Gulshan-98 and Hybrid Suncross-42) through aqueous extract bioassays against five selected weeds of wheat (i.e., Chenopodium album, Rumex dentatus, Coronopus didymus, Phalaris minor, and Medicago polymorpha). Sunflower proved to be a potential source of allelochemicals as natural herbicides for weed management of selected weeds. The allelopathic effect was found to be dosage dependant, as it gradually increased as the concentration use from 30% to 50%. The lower concentrations of 10% and 20% showed stimulatory effects or insignificant weed reduction. C. album and R. dentatus were found to be the most sensitive to various treatments. The studies were extended to pot trials to determine the ecological significance of the laboratory findings.},

  Abstract = {Antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content and flavonoid glycosides profile were compared in C. album samples grown in intensively cultivated (IC) and nondisturbed (ND) soils to evaluate differences in their nutraceutical potential. Petroleum ether, methanol, and aqueous extracts were sequentially obtained from C. album dried samples. Methanol crude extract exhibited the highest antioxidant potential and phenolic content, which were significantly enhanced by soil deterioration. This feature was enhanced in its ethyl acetate/n-buthanol subextract that also yielded higher amounts of the fraction containing flavonoid glycosides in samples grown in IC soils. Compounds were isolated by activity-guided fractionation, and chemical structure-antioxidant activity relationships were established. Chemical structures were elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic methods. Six known flavonoid glycosides were isolated, and their antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH assay. 1, quercetin-3-O-(2",6"-di-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl) -ß-D-glucopyranoside; 2, kaempferol-3-O-(2",6"-di-O-a-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-ß-D-glucopyranoside; 3, quercetin-3-O-ß-D- glucopyranosyl-(1<U+2034><U+2192>6')-/3-D-glucopyranoside; 4, rutin; 5, quercetin-3-O-ß-D-glucopyranoside; and 6, kaempferol-3-O-ß-D- glucopyranoside. Triosides 1 and 2 were identified for the first time in C. album. Our results suggest that this edible weed, ubiquitously present in cultivated fields, should be considered as a nutraceutical food and an alternative source for nutrients and free radical scavenging compounds, particularly when collected from cultivated fields that seem to increase some of its advantages. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

  Abstract = {Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) is a perennial herbaceous species containing allelopathic compounds. In a laboratory study, aqueous extracts of H. tuberosus were obtained by soaking dried leaf tissues in water for 7 h and compared with the adoption of a mechanical homogenizer. A second study was done with extracts at concentrations corresponding to 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 20% w/w of fresh leaves obtained from fresh, dried or frozen leaf tissues. The weeds Echinochloa crus-galli and Chenopodium album were used as indicator species in the first study. Digitaria sanguinalis and Zea mays were also included as indicator species in the second study. The impact of extracts was assessed in terms of total germination, speed of accumulated germination and seedling root and shoot length of the indicator species. Phytotoxic effects were observed both with the adoption of water soaking and with the mechanical homogenizer, with a reduction of total germination greater than 50% and 60% in C. album and E. crus-galli, respectively. In the second study, significant reduction in at least some of the germination indices was observed in all the indicator species, particularly at 20% extract concentration. Only in some cases differences between extracts obtained from fresh, dried or frozen leaf tissues were found. Extracts from dried leaves were generally the most effective in inhibiting germination of E. crus-galli and D. sanguinalis. None of the tested extracts reduced germination and root length of Z. mays. Single comparisons to control and a wholerange assessment performed using WESIA software pointed out that H. tuberosus leaf extracts generally affected more the speed of germination than total germination. © International Allelopathy Foundation 2008.},

Oxyfluorfen at 50 or 75 g ha-1, and oxadiargyl at 50 g ha-1 applied at 20 DAS along with one hand weeding at 35 DAS, being at par among themselves, brought maximum reduction in weed biomass production of Chenopodium spp. as well as total weeds, thereby recording (93.9-96.2%) higher weed control efficiency. However, maximum dry weight of Rumex dentatus was reduced due to the application of paraquat at 0.4 kg ha -1 + one hand weeding. Integration of oxyfluorfen at 50 or 75 g ha-1 along with one hand weeding gave comparable seed yield to weed free check and consequently provided maximum B:C ratio (2.92). Oxadiargyl+hand weeding resulted in statistically at par seed yield to that obtained with combined application of oxyfluorfen+hand weeding. Amongst the sole herbicidal treatments, oxyfluorfen 50 or 75 g ha-1 or oxadiargyl 50 g ha -1 applied at 20 DAS recorded higher WCE (83.3-88.9%) and produced significantly higher growth and yield attributing characters which led to higher seed yield, net returns and B:C ratio compared to fluchloralin 1.0 kg ha -1 PPI (recommended herbicidal control).},

  Abstract = {So far, in metamitron-resistant (Rm) Chenopodium album L. (fat-hen) collected from sugar beet fields, two psbA mutations have been identified: Ser264 to Gly (Belgian Rm-biotypes with cross-resistance to metribuzin and atrazine) and Ala251 to Val (a Swedish Rm-biotype cross-resistant to metribuzin but sensitive to atrazine). The response of Rm C. album to metamitron, either in bioassays or in chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, is not always clear-cut. Therefore, monitoring for metamitron-resistance using only metamitron is rather complicated. This problem might be solved by using other herbicides. The fact that Rm-biotypes are all cross-resistant to metribuzin and the better distinction between sensitive and resistant biotypes by this triazinone justify its use for Rm monitoring purposes. Further, a good indication about the kind of mutation present can be obtained by using atrazine or terbuthylazine. Rm-biotypes resistant to atrazine have the Ser264 to Gly mutation whereas a Swedish Rm-biotype sensitive to atrazine has the Ala251 to Val mutation. © Eugen Ulmer KG.},

Seeds of C. album were collected in different European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden) where the control with metamitron had failed. Greenhouse bioassays with metamitron pre-plant incorporated, revealed that most populations are resistant to metamitron, a key herbicide in sugar beet. The expected cross-resistance for atrazine was found in all metamitron-resistant populations except for the Swedish one, which is highly resistant to metamitron but not to atrazine. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the presence of a Ser-264-Gly mutation on the psbA gene for all populations that are both metamitron- and atrazine-resistant. This mutation on the psbA gene encoding the D1 protein of photosystem (PS) II is well known for atrazine-resistant biotypes with resistance to other PS II inhibitors in many weed species. The Ala-251-Val substitution identified in the Swedish population constitutes the first case in which this mutation conferring resistance to certain PS II inhibitors is reported in a higher plant from the field. © Eugen Ulmer KG.},

There was an increase in weed control with the FF nozzles compared with the AI nozzles in four of the 13 comparisons when the herbicides were applied at half the recommended rate, while in two situations, application with the AI nozzles resulted in improved weed control. With the FF nozzles, there was no effect of the water carrier volume on weed control with bentazon, glyphosate, and cloransulam-methyl. The control of Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) and Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters) with fomesafen and E. crus-galli with quizalofop-p-ethyl was improved at the higher water carrier volume. With the AI nozzles, the control of A. theophrasti and Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) with fomesafen and E. crus-galli with quizalofop-p-ethyl was improved at the higher water carrier volume, while the control of A. theophrasti and Polygonum persicaria (ladysthumb) was improved with glyphosate at the lower water carrier volume.

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album L. (fat-hen), a highly competitive and very prolific species, is a common weed in most spring- and summer-sown crops such as maize, sugar beet and vegetables. In the late seventies, C. album stepped into the limelight as a problem weed in maize. Frequent use of atrazine in maize monoculture did select for plants having a Ser-264-Gly mutation on the psbA gene resulting in atrazine-resistance and cross-resistance to other Photosystem (PS) II-inhibitors. The psbA gene encodes the D1 protein of PS II which is the target site of PS II-inhibitors. Introduction of new herbicides made it possible to control this atrazine-resistant biotype in maize, which allowed C. album to fade into the background again until it resurfaced some years ago as a problem weed in European sugar beet (Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Sweden). Greenhouse bioassays at Ghent University revealed that the unsatisfactory control of C. album in sugar beet is due to resistance to the triazinone metamitron, a key herbicide in sugar beet. The expected cross-resistance to atrazine and metribuzin was found in all populations except for a Swedish one, which is highly resistant to metamitron and metribuzin but not to atrazine. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the presence of a Ser-264-Gly mutation for all populations that are both metamitron- and atrazine-resistant. The Swedish population has an Ala-251-Val mutation on the psbA gene explaining its aberrant (cross)-resistance profile. The occurrence of C. album biotypes with resistance to metamitron but different genotypes and cross-resistance profiles could raise the question which herbicide(s) did select for the resistance. In Sweden, having no history of atrazine use, the triazinones metamitron, used in sugar beet, and metribuzin, used in rotational potato, could have selected for resistance. In Belgium, at least three different herbicides and/or crop rotations could have contributed to resistance development: (1) a record of continuous use of atrazine in maize resulting in triazine-resistant C. album in the seed bank, (2) metamitron use in sugar beet and (3) metribuzin use in potato.},

  Abstract = {Helianthus tuberosus L. (Jerusalem artichoke) is a perennial herbaceous species which is cultivated for human and animal consumption and sometimes reported as a dangerous weed in several summer crops. Few reports indicate that this species shows allelopathic behaviour. This study, carried out in laboratory and greenhouse conditions, investigated the effects of aqueous extracts from leaf tissues and powdered dried leaves on total seed germination, speed of germination and shoot and radicle elongation of several annual population species. Aqueous extracts were applied at 2.5, 5, 10 and 20%, to seeds in Petri dishes, and powdered dried leaves were applied at 2 t ha-1 to seeds planted in pots. The crops included in the experiments were maize (Zea mays L.), green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.). Weed species were Amaranthus retloflexus L., Chenopodium album L., Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop., Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv., Portulaca oleracea L. and Solanum nigrum L. According to their sensitivity, tested species were grouped into negligibly or poorly sensitive, sensitive to high concentrations and sensitive. Species belonging to the first group were maize, green bean, pea, C. album and P. oleracea. Species sensitive to the highest concentrations were rice, winter wheat, D. sanguinalis and S. nigrum. In the last group, which included tomato, zucchini, A. retroflexus and E. crus-galli, total germination of the last three species was reduced by about 49%, on average. S. nigrum showed no germination at 20% extract concentration. In general, speed of germination was affected more than total germination. In some cases, in particular at low concentrations, a stimulatory effect was recorded. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  Abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) is considered an important driver of crop-weed interactions, yet the mechanisms involved have been only partially explored, especially with respect to early-season growth, when competitive hierarchies are formed. This study characterises the effects of different N levels on biomass accumulation and plant morphology for maize (Zea mays), and four important weed species (Amaranthus retroflexus, Abutilon theophrasti, Setaria faberi, and Chenopodium album). Under glasshouse conditions, plants were grown in separate pots and irrigated with nutrient solution at four N concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 2, 5 µm L-1) until 57 days after emergence. Except for S. faberi, which was unresponsive to N, the relative biomass growth rates (RGR) of maize and the broad-leaved weeds were positively and similarly affected by increasing nitrogen. At all N levels, maize had a height advantage by virtue of its larger seed size, which conferred early growth benefits independent of RGR. At low N, biomass growth was instrumental to S. faberi's improved competitive position, whereas height development per unit biomass improved the competitive position of A. theophrasti, C. album and A. retroflexus. The approach presented could be applied to other crop-weed systems to evaluate environmental impacts on competitive outcomes. © 2007 The Authors.},

  Abstract = {Twelve field experiments were conducted over a 4 year (2002-2005) period to determine the influence of the herbicide dose, nozzle type, spray volume, and spray pressure on herbicide efficacy in field corn (Zea mays L.). The control of Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters), Amaranthus powellii (green pigweed), and Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyard grass) was improved with the use of full herbicide doses compared to half doses of bromoxynil, glufosinate, dicamba, and nicosulfuron. The yield was increased for bromoxynil, glufosinate, and nicosulfuron when the full herbicide dose was used. When applied at the manufacturer's recommended dose, flat fan nozzles, compared to air induction (AI) nozzles, provided better control of A. theophrasti, A. artemisiifolia, and C. album with bromoxynil, A. artemisiifolia and C. album with dicamba, and E. crus-galli with nicosulfuron. Bromoxynil, in relation to weed control, was the only herbicide that was affected by the water carrier volume. By increasing the spray pressure with an AI nozzle, there was an improvement in the control of A. theophrasti, A. artemisiifolia, and C. album with the application of bromoxynil and E. crus-galli with the application of nicosulfuron, with a yield increase with bromoxynil. Overall, this study concludes that the optimum nozzle type, water carrier volume, and spray pressure is herbicide- and weed species-specific. © 2007 University of Guelph; Journal compilation © 2007 Weed Science Society of Japan.},

  Abstract = {Experiments were conducted on four arable fields in order to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of weed populations in a 4-year crop rotation under the influence of site-specific weed control from 1997 until 2003. Winter wheat (ww), winter barley (wb), maize and sugar beet (sb) were rotated in the experimental fields. The objective of the study was to adapt a modeling tool based on Zwerger and Hurle [1990. Untersuchungen zur Abbildungsgüte simulierter Befallsverläufe bei Unkräutern. (Experiments for closeness of simulated weed infestation runs). J. Plant Diseases Prot. 97, 133-141] to forecast weed population dynamics taking into account site-specific weed control. For weed mapping, a regular 15×7.5 m grid was established in all fields. Weed seedling density was counted before and after post-emergent herbicide application and before harvest in a 0.4 m2 quadrate frame placed at all grid intersection points. Application maps were created to direct a GPS-controlled patch sprayer. The patch sprayer varied the herbicide dosage and mixture depending on the information in the application maps. Seed production of surviving weeds and seed mortality by predation and fatal germination was assessed in field studies. Data that were needed for the model and not assessed in the experiments were taken from literature. All data, including site-specific weed control, were entered in the weed population model. Distribution of Chenopodium album L. in two fields was predicted based on previous years weed distribution maps and compared to the observed data. In both fields weed density of C. album did not increase during the 6 years of site-specific weed control. Predicted and observed density values were significantly correlated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Modeling improves our understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of weed population and thus can be included in decision algorithms for patch spraying. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition, seedling emergence patterns of different weeds were studied to identify the influence of delayed emergence on weed escapes. Overall, 10 species were recorded as weed escapes and Chenopodium album L. and Solanum ptycanthum Dunal were present at all locations. Late weed emergence was the main reason of weed escapes with one-pass glyphosate. C. album showed a long period of emergence, thereby allowing the late-emerging cohorts to avoid contact with the herbicide. S. ptycanthum emerged late and therefore its entire seedling population escaped glyphosate treatment. These weeds showed a robust relation fecundity (seeds/m2) and plant ground cover. C. album ground cover of 0.1% may produce around 500 seeds/m2. © 2006.},

Total precipitation amounted 5 mm rain in each group. In all weed species, torrential rain (48 mm h-1) caused an intense glyphosate wash-off, which could in part be reduced by addition of adjuvants. In S. viridis the addition of RSO's did not enhance the biological activity if a heavy rain (5 mm h-1) was simulated, whereas addition of higher ethoxylated RSO's to the spray solution resulted in reduced dry matter in C. album. In A theophrasti the herbicidal solution containing RSO's (except RSO 30) resulted in increased bio-performance after the heavy rain. When exposed to light rain (0.5 mm h-1), no significant differences could be established in any treatment group and weed species, except for Roundup Ultramax® in A. theophrasti.

  Abstract = {In recent years, in several of the Belgian sugar beet growing regions, farmers have been confronted with unsatisfactory control of fat hen (Chenopodium album L.) by metamitron, a key herbicide in the modern low rate weed control programs in sugar beet. Greenhouse bioassays conducted on reference C. album populations and on "suspected" populations from sugar beet fields where poor fat hen control had been observed, revealed that all "suspected" populations were resistant to metamitron. These metamitron-resistant biotypes were all cross-resistant to atrazine. Since cross-resistance, particularly negative cross-resistance or reversed resistance, is known to play a major role in resistance management, other herbicides used in sugar beet and/or in rotational crops were tested to determine the cross-resistance profile of metamitron-resistant biotypes. Greenhouse bioassays were conducted using herbicides from different chemical families representing different modes of action. Cross-resistance was found for metribuzin, lenacil and chloridazon, all HRAC Group C1 herbicides that inhibit photosynthesis at PS II. The metamitron-resistant C. album populations examined showed negative cross-resistance to S-metolachlor (HRAC Group K3: inhibition of cell division), prosulfocarb (Group N: lipid synthesis, not ACCase, inhibition), aclonifen and clomazone (both Group F3: inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis). © Eugen Ulmer KG.},

  Abstract = {The annual weeds Chenopodium album L. and Galium aparine L. sensitive and resistant, respectively to phenoxy acid compounds were used as the study objects. The effects of MCPA on biochemical changes and fertility of these species were investigated. The obtained data showed that in the tissues of C. album sensitive to this herbicide, the content of the phytohormone IAA, zeatin and particularly ABA was reliably lower, and only traces of GA3 were found. In the tissues of G. aparine- resistant to MCPA, the content of zeatin and GA3 remained unchanged, while that of IAA was lower by 11 % and of ABA higher by 13 % as compared to control. MCPA exerted different effects on protein fund ESP and HSP fractions transformation. The results of the composition of protein fund, ESP and HSP fractions allow a suggestion that the features of sensitivity C. album L. and resistance G. aparine L. to MCPA, can be related to protein fund transformation and ensuring the stability of protein content and composition. In the year of MCPA spraying (1.0 l/ha), the damaged C. album ripened normally and developed seeds of higher viability. The second generation of the weed produced 34.8 % more seeds in comparison to plants unexposed to the herbicide. MCPA was found to stimulate the propagation of G. aparine already in the year of herbicide application. Therefore, the agrophytocenosis that was damaged by the herbicide MCPA naturally recovered in the following year. © Eugen Ulmer KG.},

Aqueous leachates, debris extracts, rhizosphere soil and debris amended soil were found to contain significantly higher amounts of water-soluble phenolics - the known phytotoxins. These phytotoxins in root, above-ground parts and leaves were phenolic acids, namely gallic, chlorogenic, caffeic, vanillic, p-coumaric, syringic and ferulic. Among these, chlorogenic acid was present in the maximum amount in the leaves and roots. The study concludes that C. album releases phenolics into the soil and these are probably involved in the growth inhibitory effect of C. album. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

  Abstract = {To better understand the potential for improving weed management in cereal crops with increased crop density and spatial uniformity, we conducted field experiments over two years with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) and four weed species: lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), white mustard (Sinapis alba), and chickweed (Stellaria media). The crops were sown at three densities (204, 449, and 721 seeds m-2) and in two spatial patterns (normal rows and a highly uniform pattern), and the weeds were sown in a random pattern at a high density. In most cases, the sown weeds dominated the weed community but, in other cases, naturally occurring weeds were also important. There were strong and significant effects regarding the weed species sown, the crop density, and the spatial distribution on the weed biomass in both years. The weed biomass decreased with increased crop density in 29 out of 30 cases. On average, the weed biomass was lower and the grain yield was higher in the uniform compared to the row pattern in both 2001 and 2002. Despite the differences in weed biomass, the responses of L. multiflorum, S. media, and C. album populations to crop density and spatial uniformity were very similar, as were their effects on the grain yield. Sinapis alba was by far the strongest competitor and it responded somewhat differently. Our results suggest that a combination of increased crop density and a more uniform spatial pattern can contribute to a reduction in weed biomass and yield loss, but the effects are smaller if the weeds are taller than the crop when crop-weed competition becomes intense. © 2006 The Authors.},

  Abstract = {Environmental risks of Bt maize, particularly pollen drift from Bt maize, were assessed for nontarget lepidopteran larvae in maize field margins. In our experimental approach, we carried out 3-year field trials on 6 ha total. Three treatments were used in a randomized block design with eight replications resulting in 24 plots: (i) near-isogenic control variety without insecticide (control), (ii) near-isogenic control variety with chemical insecticide (Baytroid) and (iii) Bt maize expressing the recombinant toxin. We established a weed strip (20 x 1 m) in every plot consisting of a Chenopodium album (goosefoot)/Sinapis alba (mustard) mixture. In these strips we measured diversity and abundance of lepidopteran larvae during maize bloom and pollen shed. C. album hosted five species but all in very low densities; therefore data were not suitable for statistical analysis. S. alba hosted nine species in total. Most abundant were Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae. For these species no differences were detected between the Bt treatment and the control, but the chemical insecticide treatment reduced larval abundance significantly. Conclusions regarding experimental methodology and results are discussed in regard to environmental risk assessment and monitoring of genetically modified organisms. © 2006 The Authors.},

  Abstract = {Field experiments were conducted from 2001 to 2003 at two locations in Ontario, Canada, to obtain weed control and crop tolerance data for clomazone use in transplanted tomato. The study focused on three problematic weeds: Abutilon theophrasti, Chenopodium album, and Solanum ptycanthum. Clomazone was tested at doses ranging from 120 to 840 g ha-1. The pre-transplant application of clomazone at a rate of 720 g ha-1 caused transient crop injury, with no impact on yield. Tomato yield increased as clomazone dose increased but there was no further increase in tomato yield above 600 g ha-1 at Harrow and 480 g ha-1 at Ridgetown. Although clomazone did not provide full-season biologically effective (>80%) control of these species, at least 50% mortality of weed populations for the entire season was possible for all species. To maintain full-season biologically effective control, clomazone would need to be applied at doses higher than those used in these tests. The data show that clomazone used alone is not a viable option for full-season control of A. theophrasti, C. album, and S. ptycanthum in transplanted tomato. Clomazone followed by herbicides already registered for use on transplanted tomato may be a more viable option for the control of these problem weed species while maintaining crop safety. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract = {For mechanical weeding, the uprooting force of whole seedlings and the shearing force of basal stems were measured in two grass weeds (Setaria faberi and Echinochloa crus-galli var. crus-galli) and two broad-leaved weeds (Chenopodium album and Amaranthus patulus), using balance-type equipment and a pair of scissors, respectively. Seedlings were grown in plastic pots. Uprooting and shearing experiments were carried out on the 11th, 16th, 21st, and 26th days after sowing. The uprooting force, the shearing force required to fracture the specimen, plant dry matter weight and cross-sectional area exponentially increased as seedlings grew, but the uprooting stress and shearing toughness maintained similar values after the 2nd sampling time, except for the 3rd and 4th sampling times in C. album. The increases in uprooting force and the shearing force required to fracture the specimen were supported by an expansion of the cross-sectional area of stems of the broad-leaved weeds or pseudostems of grass weeds. The higher values of uprooting stress and shearing toughness in C. album were related to an increased area of lignified organs in the basal stems. There was a significant correlation between uprooting and shearing forces. The shearing force was always higher than the uprooting force, so that most seedlings were uprooted and not fractured at the basal stems or pseudostems. The mean ratio of uprooting force to root dry matter weight after the 2nd sampling time suggested a high uprooting resistance at an extremely low amount of root dry matter weight. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

  Abstract = {In recent years, in several of the Belgian sugar beet growing regions, farmers have been confronted with unsatisfactory control of fat hen (Chenopodium album L.). Greenhouse bioassays conducted on reference C. album populations and on "suspected" populations from sugar beet fields where poor fat hen control had been observed, revealed that all "suspected" populations were resistant to metamitron, a key herbicide in the modern low rate weed control programs in sugar beet. These metamitron-resistant biotypes were all cross-resistant to atrazine. Since cross-resistance, particularly negative cross-resistance or reversed resistance, is known to play a major role in resistance management, other herbicides used in sugar beet and/or in rotational crops were tested to determine the cross-resistance profile of metamitron-resistant biotypes. Greenhouse bioassays were conducted using herbicides from different chemical families representing different modes of action. Cross-resistance was found for metribuzin, lenacil and chloridazon, all HRAC Group C1 herbicides that inhibit photosynthesis at PS II. The metamitron-resistant C. album populations examined showed negative cross-resistance to S-metolachlor (HRAC Group K3: inhibition of cell division), prosuifocarb (Group N: lipid synthesis, not AC-Case, inhibition), aclonifen and clomazone (both Group F3: inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis).},

Positive samples, i.e. TRV carriers, were given by 73 of a total of 149 weed plants, which is 49%. Two production crops in Bulgaria were found infested with the parasite weed dodder, which is another reservoir of TRV infection. Unlike the above mentioned weeds, it possibly transmits the virus to sugar beet without nematode mediators of Trichodoridae family. Based on some morphological data (yellow-orange colored stems and fruit) we assumed this was Cuscuta campestris Yuncker.

  Abstract = {A study was undertaken to assess the phytotoxicity of citronellal, an oxygenated monoterpenoid with an aldehyde group, towards some weedy species [Ageratum conyzoides L., Chenopodium album L., Parthenium hysterophorus L., Malvastrum coromandelianum (L.), Garcke, Cassia occidentalis L. and Phalaris minor Retz.]. A significant effect on weed emergence and early seedling growth was observed in a dose-response based laboratory bioassay in a sand culture. Emergence of all test weeds was completely inhibited at 100 µg/g sand content of citronellal. Seeds of A. conyzoides and P. hysterophorus failed to emerge even at 50 µg/g content. Root length was inhibited more compared to shoot length. The failure of root growth was attributed to the effect of citronellal on the mitotic activity of growing root tips cells as ascertained by the onion root tip bioassay. At 2.5 mM treatment of citronellal, mitosis was completely suppressed and at higher concentrations cells showed various degrees of distortion and were even enucleated. The post-emergent application of citronellal also caused visible injury in the form of chlorosis and necrosis, leading to wilting and even death of test weeds. Among the test weeds, the effect was severe on C. album and P. hysterophorus. There was loss of chlorophyll pigment and reduction in cellular respiration upon citronellal treatment indicating the impairment of photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism. Scanning electron microscopic studies in C. occidentalis leaves upon treatment of citronellal revealed disruption of cuticular wax, clogging of stomata and shrinkage of epidermal cells at many places. There was a rapid electrolyte leakage in the leaf tissue upon exposure to citronellal during the initial few hours. In P. minor electrolyte leakage in response to 2 mM citronellal was closer to the maximum leakage that was obtained upon boiling the tissue. The rapid ion leakage is indicative of the severe effect of citronellal on the membrane structure and loss of membrane integrity. In all, the study concludes that citronellal causes a severe phytotoxicity on the weeds. © 2006 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.},

  Abstract = {Ultraviolet-B radiation effects on intra- and interspecific competition in broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and Chenopodium album were studied using bivariate factorial experiments. A randomized block design was used in which three monoculture densities for each species [144 (low), 256 (medium), and 400 (high) plants m-2] and all binary combinations were grown in a glasshouse at two (4 and 7 kJ m-2 day-1) UV-BBE radiation levels for 4 weeks in 1999 and 5 weeks in 2000. Inverse yield-density relationships were more discernible at 4, compared with 7 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE radiation. Substitution rates, indicating the balance of intra- to interspecific competitive effects, declined for broccoli at 7, compared with 4 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE radiation, largely because of reduced interspecific competitive influences. Conversely, substitution rates increased for C. album grown at 7 kJ m -2 day-1 UV-BBE radiation, as a result of both decreased intraspecific and increased interspecific competition. Interspecific competitive effects were influenced more than intraspecific competitive effects by UV-B radiation. Based on relative magnitude of substitution rates, C. album was a stronger competitor than broccoli at 4 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE radiation in both years, and at 7 kJ m-2 day -1 UV-BBE radiation in 1999. In 2000, broccoli was the stronger competitor at 7 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE radiation. Overall, the relative competitiveness of broccoli was enhanced, while that of C. album diminished at 7, compared with 4 kJ m-2 day -1 UV-BBE radiation. These findings indicate that above-ambient UV-B radiation has the potential to alter crop-weed competitive interactions, which could change acceptable weed threshold levels. © 2005 European Weed Research Society.},

Fiori & Paol.) under rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat system in Vertisols. The zero-till planting reduced the infestation of Phalaris minor Retz. and Chenopodium album L. but increased the problem of wild oat (Avena sterillis ssp. ludoviciana). Grain yield of wheat was similar in all the tillage systems. Unchecked weed competition reduced the grain yield by 23.4% and 22.3% compared to metribuzin and isoproturon, respectively. Application of isoproturon 1.0 kg/ha at 25 days after sowing (DAS) and metribuzin 0.30 kg/ha at 35 DAS significantly reduced the population of P. minor and C. album during both the years and resulted in significantly higher grain yield than weedy check but it failed to control wild oat. The highest mean net returns (Rs 6,571/ha) were obtained from zero tillage and application of isoproturon 1.0 kg/ha. Seeds of P. minor and C. album were higher in deep tillage and A. ludoviciana and Medicago hispida in zero tillage and they were mostly distributed in upper 1 cm soil depth. Deep tillage retained higher soil moisture than zero tillage.},

  Abstract = {A tortoise beetle, Cassida nehulosa feeds on chenopodiaceous weeds, Chenopodium album and C. album var. centrorubrum as its main hosts. The beetle is known as a pest of another chenopodiaceous plant, the sugar beet. However, as a chenopodiaceous vegetable, spinach is rarely harmed by C. nebulosa. Newly emerged adults that had no feeding experience developed a positive feeding response to spinach as well as to C. album var. centrorubrum within 24 h. On the other hand, adults reared on C. album var. centrorubrum did not accept spinach, and their feeding response to spinach was still weak even after rearing on spinach for 4d. When C. nebulosa were reared on leaves of C. album var. centrorubrum treated with the methanol extracts of spinach, they accepted spinach as well as C. album var. centrorubrum. In contrast, when C. nebulosa were reared on leaves of spinach treated with the methanol extracts of C. album var. centrorubrum, consumption of spinach by the adults was less than that by the adults reared on leaves treated with solvent only. These results indicate that C. nebulosa has the potential to harm spinach due to the habituation to feeding deterrents in spinach. However, the harm to spinach by C. nebulosa could be suppressed because feeding experience on C. album var. centrorubrum can prevent C. nebulosa from habituating to spinach.},

  Abstract = {Metamitron is a key herbicide in modern low rate weed control programs in sugar beet. Fat hen (Chenopodium album, CHEAL) is a common, highly competitive, weed in sugar beet and one of the targets of metamitron. Recently, unsatisfactory control of fat hen has been reported in several sugar beet fields situated in various regions in Belgium. Weather conditions as well as the mere fact of using low rate systems have been blamed for these poor performances. To address the question "Is the recently recorded poor control of C. album due to decreased sensitivity to metamitron", greenhouse bioassays were carried out. A first experiment was conducted applying metamitron (0, 350, 700 and 1,400 g ai/ha) postemergence to three "suspected" C. album populations originating from sugar beet fields with unsatisfactory control by standard metamitron based treatment schemes ('Ligne', 'Outgaarden' and 'Boutersem I' respectively) and to one sensitive population originating from an untreated garden site ('Gent'). In a second experiment seven population, five "suspected" fat hen populations from sugar beet fields ('Boutersem I', 'Boutersem II', 'Postel', 'Vissenaken' and 'Kortessem' respectively), one sensitive reference population 'Herbiseed' and one atrazine-resistant reference population 'ME.85.01', were submitted to metamitron (0, 1, 2 and 4 mg ai/kg air-dry soil) and atrazine (1.5 mg ai/kg air-dry soil) preplant incorporated. All "suspected" C. album populations displayed a significantly lower sensitivity to metamitron compared to the sensitive populations ('Gent' and 'Herbiseed') that never had been exposed to this herbicide. As target site cross-resistance of atrazine-resistant C. album, selected by atrazine in maize, to metamitron has been known for a long time, cross-resistance of C. album populations in sugar beet grown on fields with "maize - atrazine" containing rotations might be expected to appear. The outcome of the experiment with atrazine preplant incorporated was the confirmation of resistance in all "suspected" populations ('Boutersem I', 'Boutersem II', 'Postel', 'Vissenaken' and 'Kortessem'). However, some "suspected" populations came from fields with no background of cropping with maize and use of atrazine. So, the question remains whether these triazine-resistant C. album had been imported, e.g. with slurry, or the rather unexpected possibility that metamitron itself did select for metamitron-resistant biotypes bearing cross-resistance to atrazine, had become reality.},

  Abstract = {The importance of density dependence, aggregation and background density of seeds on intensity of seed predation in cereal fields were examined in central Netherlands. Four sequential 1-week trials were conducted from 9 July to 8 August 2001 and lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album) was used as the test species. C. album was offered to potential predators by lightly adhering seeds to small strips of sand paper. The interaction between spatial scale and density dependence was tested at a large (varying seed density/block) and a small (varying seed density/card) spatial scale. Three distributions (random, even, aggregated) and two background (seed cards presented in plots with none versus many C. album seeds added to the soil) treatments were tested, all experiments being conducted simultaneously but in different fields. There was no large spatial scale density effect but in Week 4, a higher proportion of seeds was removed from the low-density seed cards. In the distribution study, significantly more seeds were removed from the aggregated distribution treatment in Week 2. In the background density study, predation was highest in Week 2 of the high background density treatment. In all experiments, there was considerable temporal and spatial variation in the intensity of seed predation. The importance of seed in the diet of seed predators declined with time, whereas the presence or the absence of density dependent predation was likely to be a function of the spatial scale at which densities were enhanced. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract = {Total weed control within a crop is both difficult and expensive to achieve, so that some weeds will often remain to set seed. The seed production resulting from these weeds will ultimately affect the sustainability of the weed control strategy. If too much is allowed to return each season there could be a gradual, but significant, increase in the potential weed flora over a number of seasons. Field trials were carried out in 2000 and 2001 to quantify the potential magnitude of this weed seed return from Chenopodium album L., grown at two planting densities either in pure stands or in competition with one of two crops (cabbage or onion). Crop and weed weights and weed seed production were notably greater in 2001. Both dry weight and seed production of C. album were suppressed by increasing planting density or by the presence of crop, with cabbage having a more suppressive effect. Despite the plasticity in seed production, a linear relationship was demonstrated between log weed seed production and log weed biomass that was robust over a range of competitive situations with onion and cabbage, at different planting densities and in growing seasons. The study also demonstrated that the relationship could be combined with an existing simple competition model to allow the consequences of incomplete weed control to be assessed in terms of potential weed seed return.},

  Abstract = {In previous glasshouse experiments, the soil bacterium Serratia plymuthica, strain A153, showed strong growth-suppressing activities against a range of broad-leaved weeds after foliar spraying. In field tests of this strain in spring wheat, spring barley and potatoes, variable effects were achieved on a range of weeds including Chenopodium album, Stellaria media, Polygonum convolvulus and Galeopsis speciosa. At one site, good suppression of C. album was observed when the strain was applied in a tank mix with another bacterial isolate or with reduced doses of a herbicide. Effects on weeds appeared to be independent of the application volume (1000, 600, 500 l ha-1), but weeds were in some cases more strongly suppressed at higher bacterial doses. Barley yields were somewhat reduced by the bacterial application, but wheat yields were less affected. Although S. plymuthica suppressed certain weeds when applied in the field in a simple aqueous formulation and with conventional spraying equipment, the level of weed suppression was unsatisfactory from a practical standpoint.},

  Abstract = {Field experiments were made in 1998 and 1999 to determine the influence of tillage and soyabean (Glycine max) row width on predispersal weed seed predation in Amaranthus retroflexus L. (redroot pigweed) and Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters). Soyabean was planted in wide (76 cm) and narrow (19 cm) rows with conventional or conservation tillage. Additional control plots without soyabean were also established. The two objectives were to determine (1) whether predispersal seed predation occurs in A. retroflexus or C. album, and (2) whether disturbance (soil tillage) or microclimate (planting pattern) influence predation level. Mean rates of seed predation were 26% and 4% in A. retroflexus and C. album, respectively. Although these levels were low at the population level, individual plants of both species had predation levels ranging from 0% to 80%, however, very few individuals of C. album had levels of predation above 10%. Differences among tillage and row width treatments occurred for A. retroflexus, but not for C. album. Amaranthus retroflexus and C. album growing within the soyabean crop received less light than those in the no-crop plots, and produced less above-ground biomass, smaller terminal inflorescences, and fewer seeds per inflorescence. Plant height, terminal inflorescence weight, and total seeds were correlated with predation in both weed species.},

Fiori & Paol.) Of the herbicides, metribuzin being most potent killer of weeds, eliminated Chenopodium album L. and gave excellent control of all other weeds. Only this herbicide paralysed severely the growth of Convolvulus arvensis L. till harvest of the crop. The next best treatment was atrazine. Its effect on C. album was similar to that of metribuzin. It gave remarkable control of Phalaris minor Retz. but its effect on Avena ludoviciana was inconspicuous while vividly vivid on all other weed species. Isoproturon gave good control of P. minor and C. album and satisfactory control of all other weed species except C. arvensis. Sulfosulfuron proved more effective than tralkoxydim in controlling A. ludoviciana. Both the herbicides were effective against P. minor. Weed population and weed dry weight were significantly lower under weed-control treatments. The lowest was in metribuzin and it proved significantly superior to all other treatments in arresting both weed population and weed dry matter. The next best treatments were hand-weeding and atrazine. Weed competition resulted in significant decrease in wheat plant height, productive tillers/m row length, grains/panicle and 1,000 grain weight and lowered crop yield by 27.2%. All the weed control treatments caused significant increase in yield attributes and yield in both the years. Hand-weeding affected maximum increase in grain yield which proved significantly superior to all other treatments except metribuzin. (150 g/ha). No significant difference existed between atrazine (100 g/ha) and metribuzin.},

Altogether, 124 isolates of V. dahliae were recovered from the vascular stem-tissue of 19 weed species, belonging to ten botanical families. Pathogenicity trials with 13 out of 19 weed species that have never been reported as hosts of the fungus, using for inoculation isolates which originated from the same weed species, resulted in infection of all of them, showing various disease symptoms. Seven weed species (Anthemis melanolepis, Cardaria draba, Convolvulus arvensis, Erodium sp., Euphorbia helioscopia, Helminthotheca echioides and Sinapis alba) are new hosts worldwide, and six additional species (Euphorbia sp., Lactuca serriola, Raphanus raphanistrum, Sinapis arvensis, Sonchus oleraceus and Trifolium sp.) are new hosts for Greece. The most susceptible (isolation frequency: 27.9-52.8%, moderate disease severity) species were: Capsella bursa-pastoris, C. draba, Chenopodium album, Senecio vulgaris and Solanum nigrum. Less susceptible (isolation frequency: 4.8-17.8%, slight disease severity) were: Amaranthus sp., A. melanolepis, C. arvensis, Erodium sp., Euphorbia sp., E. helioscopia, H. echioides, L. serriola, Malva sylvestris, R. raphanistrum, S. alba, S. arvensis, S. oleraceus and Trifolium sp. Some species - C. draba, C. album, L. serriola and S. nigrum L. - that usually showed external and vascular wilt symptoms, occasionally exhibited only reduced growth. Visible symptoms under natural field conditions in all 13 weed species that had never been reported as hosts of V. dahliae were similar to those observed after their artificial inoculation.

  Abstract = {Ascochyta caulina (P. Karst) v.d. Aa and v. Kest is a plant pathogenic fungus which is specific to Chenopodium album L. It has been suggested as a potential mycoherbicide to this weed, which is important and wide spread in arable crops throughout Europe. To investigate its potential as a biocontrol agent, the fungus has been tested in glasshouse and field experiments. Formulations containing different combinations of A. caulina conidia, the phytotoxins from the fungus and low doses of herbicides have been tested. Significant improvement in the efficacy of the fungus was achieved in glasshouse trials with an aqueous formulation containing PVA (0.1% v/v), Psyllium (0.4% w/v), Sylgard 309 (0.1% v/v), nutrients and conidia (5 × 106/ml). The extracellular, hydrophilic phytotoxins produced by A. caulina were purified and their structures determined. The main toxin, named ascaulitoxin, was characterised as the N2-ß-D-glucopyranoside of the unusual bis-aminoacid 2,4,7-triamino-5 -hydroxyoctandioic acid. Two other toxins proved to be trans-4-amino-D-proline and the aglycone of ascaulitoxin. These toxins have shown promising herbicidal properties. Field trials have investigated the performance of A. caulina conidia applied at different developmental stages of C. album either as a single treatment or combined with sub-lethal doses of herbicides or with the fungal phytotoxins. With the available formulation, favourable weather conditions are needed to obtain infection in the field. The efficacy of the strain of A. caulina used so far has proved to be inadequate to justify its development as a bioherbicide. This is probably due to its low virulence.},

  Abstract = {A model was developed to quantify the canopy development of Chenopodium album L. in response to crowding. In field experiments, C. album was planted at two densities in pure and mixed stands with either cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar, botrytis var. botrytis) or faba beans (Vicia faba L.), yielding data on plant height, maximum diameter and leaf area. Plant heights of C. album differed significantly between pure stands and mixed plots with an early cauliflower crop. Effects in a summer cauliflower planting were not as marked. Faba beans suppressed C. album, which was unable to overgrow the crop. Assumed to be mainly responsible for plant height modulation due to crowding, the leaf area index around elongating internodes was estimated. In the model, this estimate was related to the stem elongation rate yielding an accurate prediction of potential plant height growth. Because this potential was not realized under low light conditions, a feedback of assimilate shortage on height growth was introduced. Plant diameter was adequately simulated when based on plant density. As the vertical leaf area distribution did not change, it is concluded that leaf area of C. album can be predicted at every point in time and space from a given total leaf area and plant density. This information is useful in models of light competition to improve the description of weed competition effects.},

  Abstract = {Simple models were developed to quantitatively describe (a) dry matter production and (b) the effects of competition on dry matter partitioning of Chenopodium album L. Data on total biomass and its allocation to roots, stems and leaves were obtained from field experiments with C. album planted at two densities in pure and mixed stands with either cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar, botrytis var. botrytis) or faba beans (Vicia faba L.). After germination, C. album produced biomass rapidly; weeds planted at low density accumulated 20-30% less dry matter than plants growing at a 2.5-fold higher density per m2. A close correlation between the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf area index was found. Biomass production was linearly related to cumulative PAR intercepted, but a seasonal variation of the radiation-use efficiency could not entirely be explained. The root: shoot ratio was constant, whereas the level of competitive stress changed the distribution pattern between stems and leaves. With increasing competition in the cauliflower experiments, C. album allocated relatively more biomass to stems than to leaves; this was less evident in mixtures with faba beans. In field vegetable production with an abundant water and nutrient supply, the growth processes of C. album may be described quantitatively using simple functional relationships.},

  Abstract = {Stems of Chenopodium album, and Sinapis arvensis, and leaves of Lolium perenne, were cut with a CO 2 laser or with a pair of scissors. Treatments were carried out on greenhouse-grown pot plants at three different growth stages and at two heights. Plant dry matter was measured 2 to 5 weeks after treatment. The relationship between dry weight and laser energy was analysed using a non-linear dose-response regression model. The regression parameters differed significantly between the weed species. At all growth stages and heights S. arvensis was more difficult to cut with a CO 2 laser than C. album. When stems were cut below the meristems, 0.9 and 2.3 J mm -1 of CO 2 laser energy dose was sufficient to reduce by 90% the biomass of C. album and S. arvensis respectively. Regrowth appeared when dicotyledonous plant stems were cut above meristems, indicating that it is important to cut close to the soil surface to obtain a significant effect. When cutting L. perenne plants with 2-true leaves at a height of 2 cm from the soil surface with a laser, the biomass decreased significantly compared with plants cut by scissors, indicating a delay in regrowth. This delay was not observed for the dicotyledonous plants nor for the other growth stages of L. perenne.},

  Abstract = {A precise prediction of the yield losses inflicted by weeds is the basis of decisions in weed management. Hitherto, only rough estimates, which neglect the specific production situation, have been available for vegetable crops. In this study a simple simulation model was developed to estimate yield loss by radiation competition as a function of environmental variables. In the model, the distribution of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the canopy is calculated using a spatially highly resolved approach. Growth is calculated as a function of absorbed radiation and its utilisation. Newly produced dry matter is allocated to roots and shoots, the latter comprising vegetative and reproductive organs according to the developmental stage. Vegetative shoot dry matter is partitioned according to the main functions of radiation interception (leaves) and structural stability (stems and petioles). The resulting leaf area is distributed in the canopy according to the spatial expansion of individual plants. Calibration runs revealed uncertainties predicting the growth of Chenopodium album and a high sensitivity of crop yield to leaf area development of the weed. Using the area of green leaves (LAI) of C. album as input gave a close correspondence between simulated and observed crop yield loss. Since plant height of C. album is calculated as a function of leaf area, this variable has a multiple effect on radiation absorption. A first evaluation with an independent data set likewise gave an acceptable prediction. To reduce model complexity, a simplified version is proposed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A. repens, L. serriola, P. aviculare and other broad-leaved weeds was statistically significant, but the rate of decrease was not statistically significant for S. arvensis and S. altissimum. The resistance of A. retroflexus against isooctylester increased in the 4th year. The results indicate that the effects against some weeds of herbicides were reduced especially from fourth year. Therefore, the herbicides using against weeds should be changed periodically.},

  Abstract = {The development of integrated weed management programs requires a clear understanding of the factors and mechanisms conditioning weed community dynamics in agroecosystems. This study evaluated the effect of different agricultural management systems on the aboveground and seedbank weed communities in annual row crops at the Long Term Ecological Research project in agricultural ecology at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan, USA. Weed biomass and species composition were sampled for six years over two corn-soybean-wheat sequence cycles in four agricultural management systems: (1) conventional (high external chemical input, moldboard plowed); (2) no-till (high external chemical input, no tillage); (3) low-input (low external chemical input, moldboard plowed); and (4) organic (no external chemical input, moldboard plowed). A greenhouse germination study assessed variation in the abundance and composition of the weed seedbank across the studied systems in the first and sixth year of this study. Aboveground weed biomass, species density, and diversity were lowest in the conventional system, intermediate in the no-till system, and highest in the low-input and organic systems, but there were significant year-by-system interactions. Monocot and dicot species were equally common in the conventional system, whereas annual grasses, such as Digitaria sanguinalis (large crabgrass) and Panicum dichotomiflorum (fall panicum), dominated the no-till system. Two perennial weed species (Trifolium pratense [red clover] and Elytrigia repens [quackgrass]) and one annual dicot (Chenopodium album [common lambsquarters]) dominated the low-input and organic systems. A multivariate ordination of all four systems revealed close associations between the conventional and no-till systems and between the low-input and organic systems. Separate ordinations of the four management systems revealed a crop effect in the low-input and organic systems, but no differentiation in the conventional and no-till ones. The seedbank study revealed a significant increase in the number of weed seeds and species, mainly of annual grasses such as D. sanguinalis and P. dichotomiflorum, in the conventional and no-till systems over the six years of study. During the same period, the number of weed seeds declined in low-input and organic systems. Three annual dicots (Stellaria media [common chickweed], Veronica peregrina [purslane speedwell], and C. album) dominated the seedbank of the low-input and organic systems. Weed aboveground and seedbank community composition were more constant over time in the low-input and organic systems than in the conventional and no-till systems over the study period. These results demonstrate that agricultural management systems can have both immediate and long-term effects on weed species density, abundance, and diversity. The differences observed among management systems in weed biomass, species composition, diversity, and community constancy indicate challenges that exist for the development of ecologically based weed management systems in row crop agriculture.},

  Abstract = {A two-year field trial in G¨ttingen investigated various parameters for their suitability for forecasting the harmful effects of infestations of Chenopodium album and Chamomilla recutita at different times, leading to findings of the economic damage thresholds. Owing to the elastic response of the weeds to an increasing development lead of the sugar beets, the yield losses of the latter were primarily determined by the density and time of appearance of the weeds. For this reason, a forecast of the harmful effects based solely on the weed density is not possible in sugar beets. However, the combination of weed density and the stage of sugar beet development, in which the weeds sprout, offers the possibility of forecasting sugar beet yield losses. The degree of weed coverage and the relative degree of weed coverage adequately reflected at a given evaluation point the effect of the time of appearance on the occupancy-loss relationships of C. album or C. recutita when the plants had sprouted between the two-leaf and nine-leaf stages. However, when the weeds were powerfully suppressed by the beets, as in the case of C. album sprouted in the 10-13-leaf stage, the loss relationship clearly diverged. The degree of weed coverage was not suitable as the sole parameter for forecasting the harmful effects because the occupancy-loss relationships depended very much on the time of evaluation. However, the differences in the occupancy-loss relationships at different evaluation dates were substantially reduced in C. album, and almost completely eliminated in C. recutita, by resort to the relative degree of weed coverage. However, application of the latter for forecasting the harm to sugar beets is probably useful only in the case of uncompetitive weeds and with herbicides which allow later deployment in respect of the weed development stage than those currently available. Although the technical quality of sugar beets was affected in part by weed competition, this aspect may be disregarded in loss forecasting.},

  Abstract = {A binary competition experiment between carrot (Daucus carota L.) and Chenopodium album L. was conducted in a greenhouse at seven population densities and eight nutrient concentrations to investigate the effects of a nutrient gradient on plant competition in both monocultures and mixtures. The patterns of carrot biomass allocation (measured as root: shoot ratio) in monocultures and mixtures with C. album were affected by both nutrient availability and population density. Chenopodium album had a broader response to nutrient concentrations than carrot. The maximum yield of carrot in both monocultures and mixtures occurred at fourfold the standard concentration of nutrients, while C. album in both monocultures and mixtures had the maximum yield at 16-fold the standard nutrient concentration. The yield-density relationship of carrot tended to be increasing or asymptotic at lower nutrient concentrations but parabolic at higher concentrations, whereas that of C. album was little affected by nutrient availability. Nutrient availability had a profound influence on the competitive relationships between the two species: at both low and high nutrient concentrations, C. album tended to be more competitive than carrot, while at intermediate levels of nutrients, carrot was more competitive than C. album. Our results suggest that in relation to competitive performance, the weed has a greater ability to adapt itself to varying environments than does the crop. Additionally, the relative merits of the quantitative measures of competitive ability are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract = {We have studied intermediates of the recombination and replication of chromosomal mitochondrial (mt) DNA prepared from suspension cultured cells of Chenopodium album (L.) by electron microscopy during the whole growth cycle. We identified several types of potential recombination and replication intermediates including rosette-like structures, as well as other branched and sigma-like molecules. The absolute and relative amounts of these structures changed dramatically during the growth cycle, indicating high dynamics in the structural organization of the mt genome. The rosette-like molecules had sizes of 2-5 genome units and were found to contain putative replication forks and 'Holliday'-junctions known from recombination intermediates. The high number of rosettes during the first days of culture, and their drastic reduction in the stationary growth stage, were found to be inversely related to changes in the quantity of linear molecules of 40-200 kb. This observation suggests that linear molecules participate in the formation of giant branched rosette-like structures. Most Linear molecules were previously found to have at least one single-stranded end, which may allow recombinative invasion of other double-stranded molecules. Thus, recombination events may lead to the formation of more complex molecules and initiate replication similar to phage T4. We propose the coexistence of a recombination-dependent mode of replication with a presumably recombination-independent rolling-circle mode of replication in the mitochondria of C. album.},

In the greenhouse without crop cover the situation was reversed, as S media was consistently more sensitive to glyphosate than C album. An empirical simulation model of a crop rotation including glyphosate- tolerant oilseed rape predicted that the accumulation of seeds in the soil for either species was similar at a field rate (445g AE ha-1), based on field or greenhouse data. With a quarter of the recommended rate, however, the model predicted a large buildup of S media in the seedbank, especially when the simulation was based on field dose-response curves.

  Abstract = {Significant differences in some reproductive parameters of the B and Q biotypes of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) with regard to four species of winter weeds were determined in a no-choice assay. The highest fecundity (eggs) and fertility (pupae and adults) were obtained with Malva parviflora L. as host, followed by Capsella bursa-pastoris L., Brassica kaber (DC) and Lactuca serriola L. The percentage of adult emergence (from egg to adult) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) with M. parviflora, C. bursa-pastoris and B. kaber than with L. serriola. Except on L. serriola, the mean values of the reproductive parameters for the Q-biotype were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those for the B-biotype. On the other hand, in choice experiments with summer weeds, both B- and Q-biotypes preferred Datura stramonium L. and Solanum nigrum L. to Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L. and Echinochloa crus-galli L. Significantly more males and females, and more pupae and empty pupal cases per plant were found on D. stramonium than on S. nigrum. Adult abundance on A. retroflexus, C. album and E. crus-galli plants was very low. At a constant temperature of 26 ± 1 °C, the Q-biotype developed significantly faster than the B-biotype on S. nigrum and D. stramonium. Both biotypes required, for this development, significantly more days on D. stramonium than on S. nigrum. These results suggest that it is important to suppress the growth of M. parviflora, C. bursa-pastoris, B. kaber, D. stramonium and S. nigrum in order to avoid the risk of further expansion of whitefly populations where these weeds and both B- an Q-biotypes are present.},

  Abstract = {A model was developed to simulate weed emergence patterns after soil cultivation. In the model, the consecutive processes of dormancy release, germination and pre-emergence growth were modelled in separate modules. Input variables of the model were: date of soil cultivation, soil temperature and soil penetration resistance. Output variables of the model were: seedling density and timing of seedling emergence. The model was parameterized for Polygonum persicaria, Chenopodium album and Spergula arvensis with data from previous field and laboratory experiments. The model was evaluated with data from an experiment, in which emergence of P. persicaria, C. album and S. arvensis was monitored in field plots that were cultivated once only, at one of five dates in the spring. At the same time as the field observations on seedling emergence, seasonal changes in seed dormancy of the buried weed seeds were assessed by testing the germination of seed lots that were buried in envelopes. From a comparison between field observations and simulated data, it appeared that the model overestimated the rate of dormancy release in spring, whereas germination and pre-emergence growth were simulated well. In general, therefore, both the numbers of emerging seedlings and the timing of emergence could be predicted accurately, when dormancy was not simulated but introduced from experimental data. Improvement of predictions of field emergence of weeds should mainly focus on increasing the precision of the simulation of dormancy release. Close correlations were found between seedbed temperature and both the extent and rate of seedling emergence, but analysis with the simulation model revealed that they were only partly based on causal relationships, so that they have limited predictive value.},

  Abstract = {Studies were conducted to develop a model from field and laboratory studies to predict the emergence phenology of Chenopodium album. A mechanistic model to predict the phenology of weed seedling emergence across locations, years, and tillage systems is presented. This was accomplished by the integration of hydrothermal time to describe germination and thermal time to describe shoot elongation. The interaction of soil moisture and temperature in the model was accounted for by the integration of hydrothermal time in algorithms predicting seed germination. Soil temperatures within the weed seed germination zone were predicted by temperature ranges at different depths in the soil. Emergence phenology of C. album seedlings was predicted with greater accuracy under no-till and moldboard plow systems than under a chisel plow system. We attributed this lower accuracy in the chisel plow system to increased heterogeneity in the soil matrix and vertical distribution of the seedbank caused by the chisel plow. The presence or absence of Zea mays did not affect model performance. The use of soil temperature to calculate thermal time was a better predictor of C. album seedling emergence than air temperature. The ability to predict weed seedling-emergence phenology is an important component of an integrated weed management strategy.},

The dominant weed Chenopodium album had developed kotyledons and the first true leaves at the time of application. Even though the reduced herbicide doses had a 14 % lower effect, crop yields were the same as in the standard, but had a better economy due to lower costs. The regression analyses of weed dry matters (WDM) and yields showed weak relationships in 1996 and 1997 due to unfavourable site conditions. The thresholds were calculated in g WDM/m2. By reduced herbicide rates these were very low. The height of the C. album plant can be calculated from the WDM by means of a regression equation. The here presented results and results in further literature allow the recommendation for reduced herbicide applications in spring cereals in the early stage of main species by low infestations. The reliability of thresholds and ecological effects of reduced herbicide doses are discussed.},

AMS increased foliar absorption of 14C from 14C-glufosinate to the greatest extent in A. theophrasti and S. faberi and to the least extent in C. album. AMS increased the translocation of 14C out of the treated leaf 24 h after treatment in A. theophrasti and S. faberi, but not in C. album.

The greenhouse experiments indicated that the suspected resistant biotypes (R) of both species were not controlled by metribuzin applied either pre- or postemergence at rates of 245, 490, 980, and 1,960 g ai ha-1 (the higher rate is eight times greater than the rate recommended for weed control in Solanum tuberosum [potato]). However, susceptible biotypes (S) were completely controlled by 245 g ai ha-1. Also, both R- and S-biotypes of either species were effectively controlled by prometryn applied either pre- or postemergence at 1.5 kg ai ha-1. The field trials confirmed that metribuzin applied either pre- or postemergence at rates of 490, 980, and 1,960 g ai ha-1 gave fair or partial control of the R-biotype of C. album, whereas prometryn applied preemergence at 1.5 kg ai ha-1 gave excellent control of this weed. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements performed in laboratory experiments indicated that photosynthetic electron transport in metribuzin-incubated leaves detached from plants of the R-biotypes was not affected, but it was inhibited in leaves detached from plants of the S-biotypes. Electron transport was inhibited by prometryn in leaves detached from both S- and R-biotypes of either species. These results show clearly that the biotypes of both species developed resistance to metribuzin, but they were not cross-resistant to prometryn.},

Additionally, seeds sampled from the experiment in weekly intervals were tested in germination tests to assess their level of dormancy. These data in combination with weather data were taken as a basis to explain emergence of C. album in the field. The size of the seedbanks varied considerably: 66,594 seeds/m2 in conventional tillage, 123,614 seeds/m2 in reduced tillage and 322,187 seeds/m2 in the direct seeded plots. Emergence of seedlings varied accordingly: 12 seedlings/m2, 522 seedings/m2 and 4,043 seedlings/m2. Emergence appeared to be the result of an interaction between germinability of seeds and environmental factors. Despite high germinability of seeds in April and May very few seedlings emerged during these two months. In the beginning of June, after heavy rainfall in the previous two weeks, a flush of seedlings appeared. Hardly any seedlings emerged later on when germinability of seeds was strongly reduced and the soil became drier again.},

  Abstract = {A phytotoxic metabolite, characterized through NMR techniques and synthetic methods as trans-4-aminoproline, was isolated from the culture filtrates of Ascochyta caulina, a promising mycoherbicide for biological control of Chenopodium album. The metabolite, which shows interesting phytotoxic properties, together with ascaulitoxin (recently characterized as N2-ß-D-glucoside of the unusual bis-amino acid 2,4,7-triamino-5- hydroxyoctandioc acid) and another unidentified compound, compose an active fraction of A. caulina culture filtrates with promising herbicidal properties. When assayed on leaves of host and non host dicots, including wild and cultivated plants, the trans-4-aminoproline showed a wide range of toxicity, with leaves of C. album being the most sensitive. Other interesting aspects were its inefficacy on several monocots, both cultivated and wild, and its lack of antifungal, antibiotic and zootoxic activities. This is the first report on trans-4-aminoproline as naturally occurring compound and phytotoxic metabolite produced by A. caulina. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Root and sucrose yield responded to competition in the same way as biomass. However, percentage reductions were higher, as both weeds affected harvest index. The two cultivars showed the same response to competition. At the weed densities studied, crop competitive ability was favoured by late N fertilization in the presence of S. arvensis and by early N fertilization in the presence of C. album.

Two isoforms of the enzyme, with molecular masses of 67 and 72 kDa and pIs (isoelectric points) of 6.75 and 5.85, respectively, were found in crude extracts of H. persicum by western blots using an antibody against the 62 kDa isoform from maize leaves. In C. album, a C3 plant, only one immunoreactive isoform, of 72 kDa was found, with an isoelectric point of 5.85. The 67 kDa isoform was purified from H. persicum shoots by precipitation with crystalline ammonium sulfate, anion-exchange, adsorption and affinity chromatographies. The 72 kDa isoform was purified from C. album in the same way, except that the adsorption chromatography step was omitted. The 67 kDa polypeptide of H. persicum was identified as a C4 isoform based on its high specific activity, low K(m) values for malate and NADP, and characteristics of its pH optima. However, this isoform is very different in molecular mass and isoelectric point from the previously characterized C4 isoform found in C4 monocots and C4 Flaveria species. The 72 kDa isoform from C. album has kinetic properties which are distinct from the C4 isoform of H. persicum, and characteristic of the low activity constitutive form found in various plants.},

  Abstract = {Three pot experiments were performed at the University of Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd, UK during 1993 to determine if differences in the competitive ability of three annual weeds (Chenopodium album L., Sinapis arvensis L. and Phalaris minor Retz.) were related to their relative effects on leaf growth, gas exchange and nitrogen uptake of spring wheat (cv. Alexandria). In all experiments, wheat density (316 plants m-2) was similar to that in a commercial crop and five weed density treatments (between 0 and 600 plants m-2) were tested. Measurements of gas exchange were made on fully expanded, attached wheat flag leaves on four occasions between emergence and complete senescence in the control and highest weed density treatments. High weed density resulted in a lowering of net photosynthetic rate due to stomatal and non-stomatal factors. Lamina area and stomatal density of wheat flag leaves were decreased, and specific leaf area was increased by weed competition, but the effects on these variables were smaller than on net photosynthesis. Weed density did not affect wheat plant height, but dry weight, grain yield and total N-uptake were decreased with an increase in density of all weed species. The rank order of competitive ability of the species (C. album > P. minor > S. arvensis) was unaffected by weed density and was the same irrespective of whether it was based on the % decreases in wheat grain yield or in total plant dry weight. Averaged over the four measurements made during the grain-filling period there were only small differences between the weed species in their effects on net photosynthetic rate. However, when these were combined with effects on flag leaf area, there were larger differences in calculated net photosynthetic productivity, which were related to differences in the effects of weeds on grain yield. Differences in the competitive ability of weeds were not related to differences in their effects on wheat flag leaf lamina area, specific leaf area, stomatal density or total nitrogen uptake. Differences in competitive ability between weed species were not related to differences in weed plant height, dry weight or nitrogen uptake. It was concluded that the observed effects of weeds on wheat were due either to shading, or to competition for a nutrient other than nitrogen.},

  Abstract = {Absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-glufosinate were studied in three annual and two perennial weed species. Young seedlings of Setaria faberi, Chenopodium album, Cassia obtusifolia, Solanum carolinense, and Asclepias syriaca were treated with foliar-applied 14C-glufosinate, and plant tissues were harvested 12, 48, and 72 h after treatment (HAT). Absorption of 14C-glufosinate was initially rapid, but increased only slightly after 12 h in all species. Glufosinate absorption was highest in S. carolinense (73% of applied radioactivity), followed by S. faberi (54%), C. obtusifolia (44%), C. album (41%), and A. syriaca (37%) 72 HAT. Translocation of radioactivity out of the treated leaf was species dependent and did not increase much with time in all weed species. S. carolinense and S. faberi translocated the highest amounts of absorbed radioactivity out of the treated leaf with 49 to 59% moving to the upper foliage. S. faberi translocated the highest amount of absorbed radioactivity to the roots (12 to 14%), while C. album translocated the least (2 to 3%). TLC analysis of plant extracts showed that 14C-glufosinate was not metabolized in S. faberi, C. obtusifolia, S. carolinense, and A. syriaca. A glufosinate metabolite with an Rf value matching that of methyl-phosphinico propionate was detected in C. album. Treatment with ammonium sulfate (AMS) increased glufosinate absorption in S. faberi and C. obtusifolia 12 HAT, but decreased absorption in C. album. Treatment with pelargonic acid (PA) did not affect glufosinate absorption in any of the species tested. Treatment with AMS and PA did not affect glufosinate translocation in any of the five weed species. Treatment with AMS and PA did not influence the metabolism of glufosinate in any of the five weed species studied. These results show that differential absorption and translocation seem to explain the greater sensitivity of the annual and perennial weeds to glufosinate. Treatment with ammonium sulfate may increase the efficacy of glufosinate in perennial weeds.},

The tillage system affected the phenology of C. album seedling emergence only in 1995. In that year, more days were required to reach 80% cumulative seedling emergence in no-till than in the chisel or moldboard plow treatments. The delay in obtaining 80% cumulative emergence was attributed to a dry period from days 159 to 177 at Elora and from days 155 and 176 at Woodstock. The presence or absence of Z. mays did not affect soil temperatures, soil moisture, or C. album seedling emergence phenologies. Chenopodium album seedling density was influenced by tillage and environmental conditions. Large variations in seedling density were attributed to environmental conditions.

  Abstract = {An experiment was conducted at two locations in Georgia and two locations in North Carolina during 1994 and 1995 to evaluate weed management in conventional-tillage bromoxynil-resistant Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton). The weed management systems evaluated included different combinations of fluometuron preemergence (PRE), bromoxynil or bromoxynil plus MSMA early postemergence (EPOST), bromoxynil postemergence (POST), and cyanazine plus MSMA late post-directed (LAYBY). Fluometuron PRE improved control of Acanthospermum hispidium DC. (bristly starbur), Cassia occidentalis L (coffee senna), Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters), Desmodium tortuosum (Sw.) DC. (Florida beggarweed), Sida spinosa L. (prickly sida), Jacquemontia tamnifolia (L.) Griseb. (smallflower morningglory), and Anoda cristata (L.) Schlecht. (spurred anoda), compared to systems that did not use fluometuron PRE. It also improved G. hirsutum yields at three of four locations. Bromoxynil-containing systems provided better weed control and higher G. hirsutum yields than systems without bromoxynil. Bromoxynil EPOST controlled A. hispidium, C. occidentalis, C. album, D. tortuosum, S. spinosa, J. tamnifolia, and A. cristata. Control of these species was frequently improved by a second application of bromoxynil POST. Bromoxynil EPOST, POST, or EPOST plus POST did not control Senna obtusifolia (L.) Irwin and Barneby (sicklepod), but the addition of MSMA to bromoxynil EPOST improved S. obtusifolia control. Control of all dicotyledonous weeds was improved by a LAYBY treatment of cyanazine plus MSMA, and yields were improved at three of four locations with this treatment. Gossypium hirsutum was not injured by POST treatments of bromoxynil, and only temporary injury resulted from POST treatments of MSMA.},

  Abstract = {We tested whether the efficacy of chemical weed control might change as atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] increases by determining if tolerance to a widely used, phloem mobile, postemergence herbicide, glyphosate, was altered by a doubling of [CO2]. Tolerance was determined by following the growth of Amaranthus retroflexus L. (redroot pigweed), a C4 species, and Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters), a C3 species, grown at near ambient (360 µmol mol-1) and twice ambient (720 µmol mol-1) [CO2] for 14 d following glyphosate application at rates of 0.00 (control), 0.112 kg ai ha-1 (0.1 x the commercial rate), and 1.12 kg ai ha-1 (1.0 x the commercial rate) in four separate trials. Irrespective of [CO2], growth of the C4 species, A. retroflexus, was significantly reduced and was eliminated altogether at glyphosate application rates of 0.112 and 1.12 kg ai ha-1, respectively. However, in contrast to the ambient [CO2] treatment, an application rate of 0.112 kg ai ha-1 had no effect on growth, and a 1.12-kg ai ha-1 rate reduced but did not eliminate growth in elevated [CO2]-grown C. album. Although glyphosate tolerance does increase with plant size at the time of application, differences in glyphosate tolerance between CO2 treatments in C. album cannot be explained by size alone. These data indicate that rising atmospheric [CO2] could increase glyphosate tolerance in a C3 weedy species. Changes in herbicide tolerance at elevated [CO2] could limit chemical weed control efficacy and increase weed-crop competition.},

Results showed that dry matter of wheat/plant, grain yields/plant and weed dry matter/plant were reduced progressively with the increase in both weed and crop densities. However, significantly higher grain yield/pot was observed due to increase in crop density. No effect o f weed density on grain yield/pot was noted. The effect of crop and weed density on number of tillers/plant, number of panicles/plant and number of grains/panicle were similar to that of grain yield/plant. The interaction effect of crop and weed density was significant only in weed dry matter/plant when monoculture of weed was included. The crop tolerated the detrimental effects of C. album up to weed density of 224/m2 without much loss in its yield. The competitive ability of the weed as measured by aggressivity was significantly higher at low density of weed but it was unaffected under different crop densities.},

Each year, safflower was grown as a pure stand and in mixture with a natural weed infestation, mostly represented by Polygonum aviculare L., Fallopia convolvulus (L.) A. Love and Chenopodium album L., in an additive design including weed stands grown without the crop. Grain yield reduction ranged from about 50% to 80% depending on crop genotype, and was higher under spring sowing (mid-March) than under winter sowing (mid-February). In general, those genotypes incurring the least yield reduction gave the greatest suppression of weed biomass. More competitive genotypes also tended to reduce the proportion of C. album in the weed biomass at harvest, particularly in 1994 (the wetter growing season). The competitive ability of the crop was mainly correlated with its biomass at early growth stages, but was not related to its grain-yielding ability in the absence of weeds. Results showed that more competitive crops may be obtained by sowing the most competitive genotypes early. Selecting for higher competitive ability in safflower does not seem to imply a reduction in grain-yielding ability.},

  Abstract = {A new method for application of minimum lethal herbicide dose (MLHD) rates is based on the assumption that a MLHD for a photosystem (PS) II herbicide can be predicted for weeds when the developmental stage of seedlings, herbicide uptake and herbicide action are taken into account. Chenopodium album L. combines high detoxification of metribuzin with high susceptibility to this PS II inhibitor. To check whether herbicide detoxification influences the accuracy of prediction of MLHD rates, seedlings of C. album varying in age from 3 to 20 days were treated with a low (1 µM) and a high (10 µM) metribuzin concentration. Chlorophyll fluorescence, used to monitor herbicide action, indicated that both herbicide doses fully inhibited photosynthesis within 4 h of herbicide application. Thin-layer chromatography of extracts from the roots and the shoots of seedlings treated with [14C]-metribuzin for 4 h showed that detoxified metribuzin in plants was undetectable. Analyses of samples from 24 h-treated seedlings showed that 80-100% of metribuzin taken up in the roots and 40-90% of metribuzin taken up in the shoots had been detoxified. High detoxification between 4 and 24 h did not affect the efficacy of the herbicide. It was found that the growth stage of seedlings as a factor determining the size of the herbicide target did not affect the relationship between herbicide efficacy and the production of detoxified herbicide products. Differences in kinetics and compartmentalization of metribuzin action and metribuzin detoxification showed that, in C. album, both are independent processes, of which the former was faster than the latter. This demonstrates that MLHD rates for metribuzin can be reliably predicted without taking into account its detoxification.},

The influence of soil type, uprooting angle and development stage on the uprooting force of some annual weeds and carrot was studied. Sperglula arvensis L., Urtica urens L., Chenopodium album L. and carrot (Daucus carota L.) were sown in soil bins filled with four different soil types. The plants were uprooted when they had two true leaves. Soil type significantly influenced the uprooting force needed by all four species. The forces required to uproot U. urens and C. album differed significantly between peat and loamy sand. In loamy sand, Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Med., Stellaria media (L.) Vill, Chamomilla suaveolens (L.) Pursh Buch. and Viola arvensis Murr. could all be uprooted by less force than it took to uproot carrot. The uprooting angle (0°, 45°and 90°) had no significant influence on the uprooting force for carrot at the studied developmental stage. C. album, S. arvensis, U. urens, Matricaria inodora, Thlaspi arvense L. and carrot could all be uprooted by less than 1 N when they had two true leaves. Carrots required a greater uprooting force than the weeds at the three early developmental stages studied.

  Abstract = {The role of three weed management strategies on weed populations and community dynamics was investigated from 1989 to 1994. These were chemical weed control (CH), integrated weed control (IN) and mechanical weed control (ME). Weed populations and communities were analysed by univariate (species richness, rank: frequency diagrams) and multivariate (correspondence analysis) methods. Species richness of the soil seedbank differed with weed management strategies and over time, with an observed annual number of species that ranged from 18 to 32. The seedbank was dominated by the same pool of species in all cases, but these species responded differently among years and management strategies; their rank (relative abundance) and densities changed between strategy and within a strategy among the years. In the last 2 years of the study, the soil seedbank was characterized mainly by Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik on the ME strategy and Chenopodium album L. on the IN strategy. The CH strategy contrasted with the other two by the presence of a high density of Amaranthus retroflexus L.},

  Abstract = {1. Previously published literature on the population dynamics of a common arable weed, Chenopodium album, and its interactions with an arable crop, sugar beet, is reviewed with a view to (i) assessing the degree of variability in life-history traits, and (ii) parameterizing simple models of population dynamics to explore the factors determining weed abundance. 2. Comparison of previously published data sets indicates that (i) the yield-density responses of C. album in monoculture are remarkably consistent across sites and years; (ii) the per plant interspecific competitive effect of sugar beet on C. album is roughly the same as the per plant intraspecific effect of C. album; (iii) the allometric relationship between the seed production of C. album and plant biomass is invariant; and (iv) there is considerable variation in published estimates of rates of seed emergence, mortality and seedbank decay. 3. These data are used to parameterize a simple analytical model for the population dynamics of C. album in a rotation containing sugar beet. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the key parameters in determining changes in population size are the rates of emergence and mortality of seeds, as well as the rate of mortality of plants through control. 4. Using inferred levels of variability to compare deterministic and stochastic implementations of the model indicates that population sizes, and variability in population sizes, will be dominated by environmentally driven variations in the rate of seed germination and the rate of control. 5. From a practical perspective, these results indicate that (i) further information on the effects of control on plant numbers, and (ii) monitoring and prediction of emergence rates is likely to be the most successful approach to predicting weed numbers and levels of infestation. 6. The modelling shows how it is possible to use existing published data to parameterize simple analytical models, as well as to use information on scales of parameter variability with sensitivity analysis of such models to explore population dynamics. This provides an effective basis for exploring the impact of changing management on weed numbers in variable environments.},

  Abstract = {Two pot experiments were performed to investigate the effects of water deficit and competition on net photosynthesis (P(n)) of spring wheat cv. Alexandria and two C3 annual weed species (Phalaris minor Retz., Chenopodium album L.). The treatments tested included pure stands of wheat and weed species and a mixture containing them in equal proportions combined factorially with two water deficit treatments (well watered, watering withheld to maintain soil moisture at 50% of field capacity during short periods following the expansion of leaf 5 and the flag leaf of wheat). Water deficit significantly decreased P(n) of all species, the observed decreases being slightly greater in wheat and P. minor than in C. album. The decreases in P(n) were mainly due to decreases in stomatal conductance (g(s)), but changes in the concentration of sub-stomatal CO2 (C(i)) indicated that non stomatal factors were also responsible, particularly in P. minor. In wheat and C. album, but not in P. minor, P(n) recovered following re-watering. In the experiment with C. album the effect of interspecific competition was to increase P(n) of wheat and decrease P(n) of the weed. This was observed in well-watered plants and those subjected to water deficit. In the experiment with P. minor the effects of interspecific competition on P(n) varied with growth stage and were modified by water deficit. An early deficit increased the relative competitive ability of the weed, and a late deficit increased the relative competitive ability of the wheat.},

  Abstract = {The influence of weed seed predation by invertebrates and vertebrates was examined in relation to distance from hedgerows in maize fields of southwestern Michigan. Experiments were conducted in spring and winter and included five common weed species, i.e., velvet-leaf (Abutilon theophrasti), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), common lamb's -quarters (Chenopodium album), fall panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum), and yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens). In the spring post-tiliage study treatments excluding invertebrates, vertebrates, invertebrates + vertebrates plus no exclusion controls were established at 5 and 100 m from the hedgerow. Seeds were placed into the field in trays filled with sterilized soil at low densities to avoid creating a 'super stimulus' for seed predators. The trays were placed in the field for 3-4 weeks and then placed in a heated greenhouse and seed, loss was estimated from the number of seedlings that emerged. The design of the winter study was similar except that only control and vertebrate exclusion treatments were used and seeds were left in the field from December to mid-April. Significant differences among exclusion treatments were found in spring in terms of seed loss. Seed loss was lowest in the treatments that excluded both vertebrates + invertebrates and highest under no exclusion. There was some evidence of preferential predation by vertebrates upon seeds of A. retroflexus and C. album. In winter, significant seed predation by vertebrates on all species except A. retroflexus were detected. In both seasons, seed predation was high y patchy among and within fields and there was no consistent effect old stance from hedgerow.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album L. and Chenopodium polyspermum L. are cosmopolitan weeds that often cause serious crop yield losses. Although it is well known that both species compete strongly with crops, nothing has been published on their relative allelopathic potentials. Experiments for assessing the allelopathic effects of C. album and C. polyspermum on three indicator species were conducted under controlled conditions. The indicator species were sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv. SO 222), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill cv. Heinz 1370) and the cosmopolitan weed Indian goosegrass (Eleusine indica subsp. indica (L.) Gaertn.). Top growth of mature C. album and C. polyspermum plants was freeze-dried, milled to a coarse powder and gamma-irradiated. Steam-sterilized soil was mixed with the powdered material to reach a concentration of 1% for each donor species. The control treatments consisted of an untreated soil and the same soil containing 1% extracted material of the donor species. Only sunflower and tomato showed significant growth reduction in soil containing C. album material. The emergence of tomato was significantly poorer on soil containing C. album material. C. polyspermum inhibited the growth of only sunflower seedlings. In another experiment the effects of three concentrations of each of hexane, ethyl acetate and MeOH:H2O extracts of C. album and C. polyspermum on tomato seed germination were investigated. A concentration of 8 mg ml1 of the 50:50 MeOH:H2O extractable fraction from C. album material significantly inhibited germination. Extracts of C. polyspermum did not affect germination of tomato seed significantly. Results showed that C. album, and to a lesser extent C. polyspermum, have growth-inhibiting allelopathic effects. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  Abstract = {This study is part of a research program examining the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on a pasture. It was designed to examine (i) the interaction between disturbance and the atmospheric CO2 concentration at the community level, and (ii) the response of a major weed Chenopodium album to CO2 enrichment in a natural field situation. Although both the total number of species and Simpson's index increased upon disturbance, these traits did not respond to CO2 fertilization. Counter to our expectation, we found no significant interaction between disturbance and CO2. The composition of the community that established in the open, disturbed spaces was a function of seed availability and as such independent of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Using height of the background vegetation to assess the impact of elevated CO2, we found some evidence for density dependence in the undisturbed quadrats but not in the disturbed ones. For C. album, the disturbance regimes outweigh the CO2 increase in importance. Neighboring plants have a strong influence on C. album growth, this even though the C. album photosynthetic mechanisms are potentially responsive to elevated CO2. The present study highlights the complex feed-back interactions occurring when a community is exposed to elevated CO2 concentration.},

The treatments tested included monocultures of each species and a mixture containing them in equal proportions that were combined factorially with two levels of N supply (20, 120 kg N ha-1). Low N supply decreased net photosynthetic rate (P(n)), leaf N percentage, plant dry weight and N uptake of both wheat and weed species and grain dry weight of wheat. The effects of low N on P, and dry weight of weeds were greater than the effects on wheat. In most cases the decrease in P(n) at low N was due to non-stomatal factors. The relative competitive abilities of wheat and weeds were influenced by N supply. At high N, S. arvensis was more competitive than wheat, whereas P. minor was less competitive than wheat. C. album was more competitive than wheat at both N levels. The rank order of competitive ability of the weed species was C. album > P. minor > S. arvensis. The effects of interspecific competition on P(n) were smaller than the effects of N supply and were not associated with corresponding effects on leaf N percentage and plant dry weight of both wheat and weed species and grain dry weight of wheat.},

In this study, seeds of Chenopodium album L., Amaranthus retroflexus L., and Abutilon theophrasti Medik, were planted at particular depths in pots of undisturbed or stirred soil to separate these effects. Emergence and survival data were analysed by non-linear regression to determine the nature of significant differences between treatments. Emergence increased with slight burial and then decreased exponentially at greater depths. Average emergence over all depths was generally greater in tilled soil than in untilled soil, particularly for C. album and A. retroflexus. Seed survival approached a maximum with increasing depth. Average survival of seeds that did not produce emerged seedlings was greater in tilled soil than in untilled soil for C. album and A. retroflexus. Thus, tillage affects emergence and seed survival of weeds through changes in soil conditions independently of effects resulting from redistribution of seeds in the soil profile.},

  Abstract = {Chenopodium album is a worldwide-distributed plant species growing in disturbed habitats. It is an abundant and very competitive weed in spring-sown crops, particularly if they retain an open structure for a relatively long period. In most crops it is currently controlled by herbicides. In some crops, such as maize, chemical control is difficult, because C. album has become resistant to these herbicides. In other crops, such as sugar beet, the use of herbicides could be reduced considerably if selective control of C. album were possible. Recent experiments using the fungus Ascochyta caulina as a microbial herbicide to control C. album are encouraging (up to 70% control under field conditions). Within the framework of a COST action on 'Biological Control of Weeds in Europe', five countries have cooperated in developing a biological control method for C. album. To integrate the biological control of C. album in existing weed management systems is one of the remaining challenges.},

Experiment 1 was performed with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), Galeopsis tetrahit L., and Viola Arvensis Murray. Experiment 2, with three irradiance levels at 20/14°C, and one irradiance level at the other temperatures, was performed with spring barley, V. arvensis, Chenopodium album L., Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera (DC.) Metzger, and Stellaria media (L.) Vill. Leaf area, dry weight, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, and net photosynthetic rate generally showed an optimum at 20/14°C. Increasing irradiance resulted in a decreased specific leaf area. Expressed as fraction of shoot dry weight, green leaves decreased and stems, flowers, and yellow leaves increased with increased time, irradiance, and temperature. At all temperatures, barley, B. rapa and G. tetrahit had the largest dry weights, but at 20/14°C, C. album and S. media and at 30/21°C C. album also had large values. Differences in dry weight between species correlated more to morphological features than to assimilation rate.},

Metzger, Chenopodium album L., Galeopsis tetrahit L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill., and Viola arvensis Murray). Increased irradiance resulted in larger dry weight, net photosynthetic rate, relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), and lower leaf area ratio (LAR). The number of leaves per plant, plant length, leaf area, and shoot/root ratio were unaffected by irradiance levels. During the experimental period the net photosynthetic rate increased, while NAR remained the same, and RGR, LAR, and shoot/root ratio decreased. On the basis of leaf area and dry weight, especially at the high irradiance level during the last part of the experimental period, barley, B. rapa, and G. tetrahit had the largest values, followed by C. album and S. media with medium values, and V. arvensis with the smallest values. As for leaf area and dry weight, S. media took more advantage of the low than the high irradiance level compared with C. album. Species differences are discussed with regard to competitive ability.},

  Abstract = {Effects of soil application of Ascochyta caulina spores on seedlings of Chenopodium album and five cultivated plant species were investigated under greenhouse conditions as a part of a study on biological control of C. album. Application of A. caulina spores to soils resulted in disease development on C. album and to a lesser degree on Spinacia oleracea seedlings, but not on Beta vulgaris subspecies vulgaris, Zea mays, Triticum aestivum and Pisum sativum seedlings. Affected C. album seedlings had an abnormal olive-green colour or necrotic spots on cotyledons and hypocotyls, and were stunted or died. Affected S. oleracea seedlings were pale in colour or had necrotic spots on the cotyledons, but did not die. Time courses of disease incidence and of mortality of C. album could be described by a monomolecular model. Effects of spore density, sowing depth, soil water content, soil type and time of sowing on disease development were examined. Disease incidence and mortality were influenced by spore density, soil water content and soil type, but not by sowing depth, Spores in a moist soil maintained infectivity at least 2 wk. Spore densities of 109 to l010 spores m-2 were required for 50% mortality of emerged C. album plants. Aspects of the development of A. caulina into a soil-applied mycoherbicide are discussed.},

  Abstract = {Ascochyta caulina is considered a potential mycoherbicide against Chenopodium album. Disease development of C. album plants and plants of 14 other species after application of pycnidiospores of A. caulina was studied in climate chamber experiments. The experiments were carried out to analyse disease development with time, and to recognize factors that may limit disease development. Two time courses of necrosis of C. album plants were observed, (1) an increase of necrosis followed by a decline, and (2) an increase of necrosis up to completion with subsequent plant death. Courses of necrosis with time could be described by a non-monotonic, critically damped model when plants survived infection and by a monomolecular model when plants died from infection. Disease development was influenced by interactions between wetness period, density of the spore suspension applied, plant development stage at the time of spore application, and temperature. Disease was favoured by a long wetness period, a high number of spores applied, an early plant development stage at the time of spore application, and temperatures of 18°C and higher. Disease development was limited to plant species of the genera Chenopodium, A triplex and Spinacia with differences between the species. Pathogenicity differed significantly between three A. caulina isolates tested. Variation in resistance between four source populations of C. album was small. Prospects for A. caulina as a mycoherbicide are discussed. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  Abstract = {The emergence pattern and life cycle of four major species growing in a non–irrigated almond tree grove were analysed in relation to ploughing frequencies and environmental factors. At the community level, the overall emergence pattern was found to be much the same whether or not the soil was disturbed. Nevertheless, soil disturbance in late winter and early spring produced peaks of seedling emergence and brought about an increase in germination. Winter annuals such as Lolium rigidum Gaudin and Diplotaxis erucoides (L.) DC., which emerged in the autumn, started to grow rapidly in winter and spring and were able to pre–empt the environmental resources of the habitat and suppress spring–germinating plants such as Chenopodium album L. and Amaranthus blitoides S. Watson. Late–winter and early–spring disturbances favoured the dominance of summer annuals such as C. album and A. blitoides S. Watson. The different ploughing regimes applied during the first year had effects on plant development and seed production which brought about changes in plant population size during the second year.

  Abstract = {Growth, development and nutrient accumula tion in Chenopodium album and Senecio vulgaris grown in pure and mixed stands were investi gated through several experiments conducted under glasshouse conditions. Results showed that the two weeds were different in their growth, development and tissue concentration and accu mulation of mineral elements. The mean concen trations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium in shoots of C. album were higher than those of S. vulgaris, while root concentrations of nitrogen, potassium and mag nesium were lower for C. album. Marked dif ferences between the two weed species in their responses to different potassium levels were found. C. album had a high specific requirement for potassium while the reverse was true for S. vulgaris. The competitive ability and accumula tion of nutrients by C. album appeared to be greatly dependent on the availability of high potassium levels in the media. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

  Abstract = {Laboratory and glasshouse studies were conducted to assess the allelopathic effect of Chenopodium album L. on the germination and early growth of certain crop species. Test species were grown in soils containing 1% (m/m) freeze-dried shoot material of the weed. Aqueous extracts of soils containing weed residues and organic solvent extracts of shoots of the weed were tested for effects on the germination of certain crop species. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) was the only crop not affected by the weed residue in the soil. Growth inhibition was 68% for cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), 85% for onion (Allium cepa L.), 47% for tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and 51% for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Except for radish and sunflower, stand loss contributed to reductions in growth. Germination of crop species was not affected by aqueous extracts of soil portions (100g) from soil either grown with the weed (residues later removed by sieving) or containing shoot material of the weed. In fact, the growth of radicles of certain species was stimulated in the latter extract. The ethyl acetate, 100% and 50% methanol extractable fractions of C. album shoots inhibited germination of the single test plant (onion). The hexane extractable compounds slightly retarded germination. It is suggested that C. album contains allelochemicals which may inhibit seed germination and growth of certain crop seedlings. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  Abstract = {The responses of Chenopodium album L. and Senecio vulgaris L. to inter- and intra-specific competition were investigated in both additive and replacement series experiments under glasshouse conditions. When grown with tomato the two weed species had similar effects on shoot dry weight at low densities but 5. vulgaris showed more competitive effect at higher densities. Weed density did not affect the concentrations of N, P, K, Ca or Mg in tomato shoots but dry matter and total amounts of nutrients were reduced increasingly with the increase in density of both weeds. The concentration of nutrients in the shoots of the weeds was not affected by density but dry matter yield and total nutrient accumulation per plant fell as the density increased. The concentrations of N, P, K and Mg in the shoots were higher in C. album than S. vulgaris but that of Ca was lower. In a replacement series experiment the two weed species behaved differently. With C. album, both dry matter yield and total nutrient per plant were reduced as its proportion in the mixture increased but, with S. vulgaris, dry matter per plant increased with its proportion in the mixture. One plant of C. album grown with five S. vulgaris gave a higher shoot dry weight than when present in higher proportions or in a pure stand. In a pure stand of six plants the shoot dry weight per plant of C. album was 26% of that of one plant grown with five S. vulgaris. In comparison, the shoot dry weight of one S. vulgaris in pure stand was 120% of that of one plant grown with five C. album. The reduction in growth of C. album was associated with a greater reduction in its ability to accumulate K than other elements. The competition index (CI) of C. album in terms of dry weight decreased with its proportion in the mixture but the reverse was true for S. vulgaris. The relative competitive ability index (RCAI) of C. album was almost 3–5 times that of S. vulgaris. The results showed that differences between the weeds in inter- and intraspecific competition were closely related to the growth of their root systems. Compétition inter- et intraspécifique du chénopode (Chenopodium album L.) et du senecon (Senecio vulgaris L.) Les réponses du chénopode (Chenopodium album L.) et du sénecon (Senecio vulgaris L.) à la compétition inter- et intra-spécifique ont étéétudiées en serre lors d'expériences à séries additives ainsi qu'à séries de remplacement. Quand elles étaient cultivées avec des tomates, les deux mauvaises herbes avaient des effets similaires sur la matière sèche des parties aériennes à faibles densités, mais S. vulgaris se montrait plus compétitif à fortes densités. La densité des mauvaises herbes n'affectait pas les concentrations en N, P, K, Ca et Mg dans les parties aériennes de la to-mate. Par contre, la matière séche et les quantités totales de nutriments étaient d'autant plus réduites que la densité des deux mauvaises herbes était élevée. La concentration en nutriments dans les parties aeriennes des mauvaises herbes n'était pas affectée par leur densité mais le rendement en matière sèche et l'accumulation totale de nutriments par plante décroissaient lorsque la densité augmentait. Les concentrations en N, P, K et Mg dans les parties aériennes étaient plus élevées chez C. album que chez S. vulgaris mais celle de Ca était plus basse. Dans une expérience à séries de remplacement, les deux espèces de mauvaises herbes se comportaient différemment. Chez C. album, le rendement en matière sèche ainsi que la quantité totale de nutriments par plante diminuaient lorsque sa proportion dans le mélange augmentait mais, chez S. vulgaris, la matière sèche par plante augmentait avec sa proportion dans le mélange. Un pied de C. album cultivé avec 5 pieds de S. vulgaris produisait davantage de matière sèche aérienne que lorsqu'il était présent en proportions plus importantes ou en culture pure. Dans une culture pure de 6 plantes, la matière sèche aérienne par pied de C. album représentait 26% de celle d'une plante cultivée avec 5 pieds de S. vulgaris. En comparaison, la matière sèche aérienne par pied de S. vulgaris en culture pure représentait 120% de celle d'une plante cultivée avec 5 pieds de C. album. La réduction de croissance de C. albumétait associée à une réduction de sa capacitéà accumuler K, qui était plus marquée que pour les autres éléments. L'Indice de Compétition de C. album en terme de matière sèche diminuait avec sa proportion dans le mélange, mais l'inverse était vrai pour S. vulgaris. L'Indice Relatif d'Aptitude à la Compétion de C albumétait presque 3,5 fois plus élevé que celui de S. vulgaris. Les résultats montraient que les différences entre les mauvaises herbes en ce qui concerne la compétition inter- et intra-spécifique étaient étroitement liées à la croissance de leur système racinaire. Inter- und intraspezifische Konkurrenz des Weißen Gänsefußes (Chenopodium album L.) und des Gemeinen Greiskrauls (Senecio vulgaris L.) Die inter- und intraspezifische Konkurrenz von Chenopodium album und Senecio vulgaris wurde sowohl in additivem als auch substitutivem Versuchsansatz im Gewächshaus untersucht. In Mischbeständen mit Tomate hatten beide Unkrautarten bei geringer Pflanzendichte eine ähnliche Wirkung auf die Sproß-Trockenmasse, doch Senecio vulgaris war bei hohen Dichten konkurrenzstärker. Die Unkrautdichte hatte keinen Einfluß auf den N-, P-, K-, Ca- oder Mg-Gehalt der Tomatensprosse, aber die Trockenmasse und der gesamte Nährstoffgehalt nahm mit zunehmender Dichte der beiden Unkräuter ab. Der Nährstoffgehalt in den Sprossen der Unkräuter wurde durch die Pflanzendichte nicht beeinflußt, aber die Trockenmasse und der gesamte Nährstoffgehalt nahm mit zunehmender Dichte der beiden Unkräuter ab. Der N-, P-, K-und Mg-Gehalt war bei Chenopodium album höher als bei Senecio vulgaris, doch der Ca-Gehalt war niedriger. In einem substitutiven Versuchsansatz verhielten sich die beiden Unkrautarten verschieden. Bei Chenopodium album wurden sowohl die Trockenmasse als auch der gesamte Nährstoffgehalt pro Pflanze im selben Maße reduziert, wie sein Verhältnis im Mischbestand zunahm; bei Senecio vulgaris stieg die Trockenmasse pro Pflanze mit seinem Anteil im Mischbestand an. Chenopodium album entwickelte bei einem Mischungsverhältnis von l Pflanze zu 5 Senecio-vulgaris-Pflanzen eine höhere Sproß-Trockenmasse als bei höheren Verhältnissen oder im Reinbestand. In einem Reinbestand von 6 Pflanzen war bei Chenopodium album die Sproß-Trockenmasse pro Pflanze 26 % der Masse einer Pflanze, die mit 5 Senecio-vulgaris-Pflanzen wuchs. Bei Senecio vulgaris dagegen war die Sproß-Trockenmasse pro Pflanze im Reinbestand 120 % der Masse einer Pflanze, die mit 5 Chenopodium-album-Pflanzen wuchs. Mit der Wuchshemmung ging bei Chenopodium album eine Abnahme seiner Fähigkeit, K und andere Nährstoffe aufzunehmen, einher. Der Konkurrenzindex von Chenopodium album, bezogen auf die Trocken-masse, nahm mit seinem Anteil in den Mischbeständen ab, während bei Senecio vulgaris das Gegenteil der Fall war. Die relative Konkurrenzfähigkeit von Chenopodium album war fast 3.5mal so groß wie die von Senecio vulgaris. Die Unterschiede der inter- und intraspezifischen Konkurrenz der beiden Unkrautarten stand in enger Beziehung zur Entwicklung ihres Wurzelsystems. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

  Abstract = {Triflusulfuron methyl (methyl 2-[[[[[4-(dimethylamino)-6-(2,2,2-triftuoroethoxy)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-3-methylbenzoate), formerly DPX-66037, is a new selective postemergence sulfonylurea herbicide for the control of annual and perennial broadleaf weeds and grasses in sugar beets (Beta vulgaris). Similar to other sulfonylureas, the site of action of triflusulfuron methyl is acetolactate synthase (ALS), an enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. This herbicide is unique in this class in its safety on sugar beets, a crop that has often been used as an indicator of residual sulfonylureas in soil. We investigated the mechanism of selectivity by comparing the response of sugar beets with that of sensitive weeds (Brassica napus, Matricaria inodora, and Veronica persica) and a moderately tolerant weed (Chenopodium album). Studies of foliar uptake and in vitro inhibition of ALS across these species discount differential uptake or active site sensitivity as the basis for sugar beet tolerance to this herbicide. However, a good correlation between metabolism and plant tolerance does exist. Sugar beets metabolize triflusulfuron methyl very rapidly (half-life of <1 hr) while C. album has an intermediate rate (half-life of 7 hr) and the sensitive weeds have slow rates of metabolism (half-lives of >35 hr). The initial metabolism of triflusulfuron methyl in sugar beets involves nucleophilic attack by glutathione at the urea carbonyl group producing the S-carbamoyl glutathione conjugate plus 7-methylsaccharin and its free acid. The 2,6-disubstituted sulfonamide appears essential for this metabolism, but surprisingly even minor changes on the triazine ring have a profound effect on sugar beet tolerance. Although the data strongly suggest enzymatic involvement, attempts to determine if glutathione-S-transferase was involved proved inconclusive. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

  Abstract = {In a root disease survey in the west part of Scania in southern Sweden, Aphanomyces spp. were obtained from roots of spinach, sugar beet, red beet, barley, oats, pea, and also from eight weed species found in spinach and pea fields. Morphological studies, pathogenicity tests performed on spinach, sugar beet, pea, barley, oats, tomato and radish, and isozyme analysis revealed four distinct groups or species. A. euteiches was isolated from pea and Lamium amplexicaule. The isolates were highly pathogenic on peas, but also slightly pathogenic on spinach. A. cochlioides was found on roots of sugar beet, red beet, spinach and Chenopodium album. This species was highly pathogenic on sugar beet and somewhat less so on spinach. The Aphanomyces sp. most frequently found on spinach roots, but also isolated from roots of sugar beet, red beet, barley, oats, C. album, Polygonum convolvulus, Senecio vulgaris, Stellaria media, Urtica urens, Veronica agrestis and Viola arvensis was identified as A. cladogamus. These isolates were, however, not pathogenic on tomato. They were moderately to highly pathogenic on spinach and weakly pathogenic on sugar beet. The fourth group of isolates had considerably larger oogonia and oospores than the other three groups. This unidentified Aphanomyces species was isolated from roots of spinach and barley. It was moderately pathogenic on spinach and sugar beet, and weakly pathogenic on barley. Several isolates from each group were compared by isozyme analysis. The intraspecific variation was low, and two enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, clearly differentiated between the four species. © 1994, British Mycological Society.

Chenopodium album and S. vulgaris were considerably different in their competitive abilities, although similar differences among the three food-crop species were found. Senecio vulgaris was affected more by the competition than C. album and had lower tissue concentrations of N, K, and Mg. Growth of both weeds was greatly suppressed when tomato emerged two weeks earlier than the weeds, but the crop plants were severely stunted when the weeds had two weeks initial advantage. It appeared that C. album competed with the three food crops more for K than other elements, while S. vulgaris competed better for P. Cabbage was more competitive with both weed species than tomato while lettuce was the least competitor. Some aspects of these differences in competitive ability among the species could be related to their nutrient use. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

'Big Max' and four weedy species, Amaranthus hypochodriacus L., Amaranthus hybridus L., Chenopodium album L. and Abutilon theophrasti, were grown at two different CO2 concentrations of 350 µl l-1 (ambient) and 700 µl l-1 (elevated) in controlled-environment chambers to determined the effect of elevated CO2 on germination and emergence. Doubling the CO2 concentration resulted in an increase in the rate and final percentage of germination, for M. sativa, A. hybridus and C. album. In a separate field experiment (silt-loam soil), elevated CO2 resulted in a significant increase in the total number of weed seedlings present 3 weeks after tilling. In a second set of experiments using controlled-environment chambers, the interaction between increased temperature and CO2 was examined in seven of the species used previously. No significant interaction was observed between CO2 and temperature on the germination response. Overall, this investigation suggests that as CO2 increases, differential changes in germination and/or emergence between crops and weeds could occur. © 1993.},

  Abstract = {For annual weeds in the US Corn Belt, critical ecological information includes seedbank density, seed dormancy, seedling emergence, and environmental variables that regulate these factors. For Setaria spp., Amaranthus retroflexus, and Chenopodium album in Minnesota, this information is summarized, and its application to weed management is illustrated. If weed seedbank densities (0-10 cm depth) are <100 seeds/m2 prior to spring tillage operations, subsequent seedling populations are too low (<40 seedlings/m2) to require control. Seedbanks ranging from 100-1000 seeds/m2 produce seedling populations (<400 seedlings/m2) that can be controlled mechanically. In contrast, pre-tillage seedbanks >1000 seeds/m2 typically result in such high seedling populations that nonchemical control measures alone cannot prevent large crop yield losses. About one-half of all arable fields harbor seedbanks with densities >1000 seeds/m2. The proportion of buried seeds giving rise to seedlings is controlled by seed dormancy, in turn governed partially by April temperatures (in Minnesota), whereas the timing of subsequent seedling emergence is determined by soil temperature and soil water. If seedbeds of fields with potential seedling densities of 100 seedlings/m2 are prepared and sown when simulated emergence exceeds c80% for C. album, 85% for A. retroflexus, and 99% for Setaria spp., then mechanical weed control sufficiently reduces weed populations and crop yield losses are negligible. -from Authors},

  Abstract = {The host range of Polymyxa betae on common arable weed species in Britain was determined by growing plants in naturally infested soil and examining their root systems for the presence of resting spores (cystosori). Of the 24 species tested, only Atriplex patula and Chenopodium album of the Chenopodiaceae, and Silene alba of the Caryophyllaceae, were found to be heavily infected. S. alba is a newly recorded host species for Polymyxa. The host specificity of isolates of P. betae from Beta vulgaris, C. album and A. patula was investigated by observing which of 11 test plants could be infected by the isolates obtained from this soil. Three main biotypes of P. betae appeared to be distinguishable: one which was able to infect all chenopodiaceous species; one which had a narrower host range; and one which was able to infect S. alba. The role of weed species in the epidemiology of rhizomania is discussed. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  Abstract = {Buried seeds often show seasonal periodicity of dormancy. Dormancy patterns of Chenopodium album, Polygonum persicaria, Sisymbrium officinale and Spergula arvensis were studied by burying seeds under field conditions in sandy loam in December, 1986. Seeds were exhumed at regular intervals and germination was subsequently tested in the laboratory. It was shown that the conditions of the germination test influenced the expression of the dormancy pattern. Germination of C. album and 5. arvensis always depended on the presence of light, whereas seeds of S. officinale completely lost their light dependency during the first winter. Application of nitrate during the germination test in light improved germination of all species. Dark germination was not stimulated by nitrate alone. Desiccation of the exhumed seeds at a r.h. of approx. 15% enhanced germination under all conditions. A combination of several stimulating factors revealed breaking of dormancy much earlier in the season. During induction of secondary dormancy the effect of the test conditions was even more pronounced. Dormancy induction could be overlooked for several months when seeds were desiccated and/or given nitrate during the germination test in light. It is hypothesized that in the field both desiccation - due to cultivation and dry spells - and nitrate enrichment of the soil will influence the expression of the seasonal pattern of dormancy and therefore enlarge the period of possible seedling emergence © 1989 Annals of Botany Company.},

After 0, 1, 3 and 5 months, seeds of each species at each temperature were exhumed and tested at a 14-h daily photoperiod at all six temperatures. Fresh seeds of A. artemisiifolia and P. pensylvanicum did not germinate at any temperature, those of A, hybridus germinated to 4 and 64% at 30/15 and 35/20°C, respectively, and those of C. album to 11–20% at 25/15, 30/15 and 35/20°C. Seeds of A. artemisiifolia and P. pensylvanicum, which germinate only in spring, required exposure to low (5, 15/6°C) temperature to after-ripen completely (i.e., to gain the ability to germinate over a wide range of temperatures), and little or no after-ripening occurred at high (25/15, 30/15 and 35/20°C) temperatures. Seeds of A. hybridus and C. album, which germinate in spring and summer, required exposure to low temperature to after-ripen completely, but at high temperatures they rapidly gained the ability to germinate at high temperatures. Regardless of the burial temperatures and species, when after-ripening occurred, seeds firs germinated at high and then at low temperatures. The minimum germination temperature for a species decreased with after-ripening temperature and with an increase in the length of the burial period. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Both weed species interfered with rapeseed early in the growing season, causing significant reductions in rapeseed dry weight by June of each year. Sinapis arvensis caused greater rapeseed grain yield reductions than did C. album. With weed densities of 20–80 plants m-2, rapeseed grain yield reductions ranged from 19 to 77% with S. arvensis but only 20 to 25% with C. album. Rapeseed yield reductions caused by mixtures of both weed species ranged from being less than to being equal to the sum of reductions caused by each weed alone, depending on the weed density and year of study. Both weed species were prolific seed producers capable of returning large quantities of seed to the soil. With weed densities ranging from 10–80 plants m-2, S. arvensis produced 5700–30 100 seeds m-2 while C. album produced 3100–63 600 seeds m-2. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  Abstract = {Wheat Triticum aestivum, an erect broad-leaved herb Chenopodium album, an erect grass Agropyron repens, and a decumbent herb Spergula arvensis were grown in pure stands and in mixtures of weeds with wheat at normal sowing rates. In the pure wheat stands, plant survival followed an almost perfect Pearl (1928) type 1 curve, typical of organisms which die mainly from physiological senescence. Demographic patterns of leaves changed abruptly after ear emergence. Quite small differences in individual plant size early in the experiments resulted in significant differences in final grain yield. The individual leaf area of wheat, C. album and S. arvensis declined after onset of flowering. Increased density caused a reduction in individual leaf area in all weed species. Distribution of wheat leaves in the canopy was affected by presence and density of weeds, more than the total number of wheat leaves. Only C. album at high density caused a reduction in wheat grain yield. Wheat reduced the number of leaves of weeds and changed their distribution within the canopy, with proportionately fewer weed leaves in the lower part of mixed stands than pure stands. Weeds of mixed stands were constantly shaded by wheat leaves and produced significantly less biomass than weeds of pure stands. -from Author},

  Abstract = {Alpha-terthienyl (a-T), a naturally occurring polyacetylene derivative from roots of Tagetes erecta L., and phenylheptatriyne (PHT), from leaves of Bidens pilosa L., were tested as possible allelopathic agents against four seedling species (Asclepias syriaca L., Chenopodium album L., Phleum pratense L., Trifolium pratense L.). Asclepias was the most sensitive of the species. Allelopathic activity was enhanced in the presence of sunlight or sources of near-UV, with LC50s for A. syriaca of 0.15 ppm and 0.66 ppm with a-T and PHT, respectively; 0.27 and 0.85 for C. album; 0.79 and 1.43 for P. pratense, and 1.93 and 1.82 for T. pratense. Near-UV exposure was saturating but never more than found in summer sunlight at Ottawa, Canada. Growth inhibition was observed with seedlings treated with a-T and PHT but without near-UV irradiation. Germination of seedlings was also sensitive to a-T and PHT with or without near-UV treatment. a-T was extracted from soil surrounding the roots of Tagetes. Concentrations calculated for the soil (0.4 ppm) indicate that seedling growth could be significantly hindered. The activity and specificity of a-T was sufficiently high to warrant future field trials to assess its potential as a natural weed-control agent. © 1982 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

  Abstract = {Field experiments at Sutton Bonington between 1970 and 1974 tested how crop yields were affected by hand weeding at different stages in the life of early- and late-sown crops. Losses where weeds were never controlled ranged from 95 where tall-growing Ohenopodium album L. predominated to 50 when Stellaria media (L.) Vill. and Tripleurospermum maritimum L.) Koch ssp. inodorum Hyl ex. Vaarama (T. inodorum) were most involved. In five of the seven crops examined the latest date (X) at which weeding had to commence to prevent irreversible effects on growth and yield and the earliest date at which weeding could cease without yield loss (Y) coincided. For late March/early April sowings this occurred 6 weeks after crop emergence, while for late April/early May sowings in which events were more rapid the same stage was reached 4 weeks after emergence. For an early-sown crop in 1973, when rainfall was frequent and heavy and C. album prolifiC. X preceded Y with an interval of 4 weeks between the two dates (4-8 weeks after crop emergence, mid-May to mid-June). In complete contrast for a late-sown crop in 1974, when the weather was exceptionally dry and G. album virtually absent, Y preceded X and a single weeding at any time between 2 and 8 weeks after emergence would have prevented yield loss. Sugar beet had generally reached the late singling stage (4-6 true leaves) by the time weeding must have commenced. During the next 6 weeks, final yield was depressed by 120-150kg/ha (1.5) with each day that weeds were allowed to remain. However, leaf production continued throughout the season and the crop was capable of recovering from early checks caused by weed competition. It proved possible for crops whose weights were depressed by 25-30 when first weeded to recover completely by harvest. © 1979, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Chenopodium album L., and Amaranthus retroflexus L. are three summer annual weeds that occur in disturbed habitats. In nature, the peak germination season for A. artemisiifolia and C. album is in early to mid-spring, while in A. retroflexus the peak germination season is late spring to early summer. Furthermore, seeds of A. artemisiifolia germinate only in spring, while seeds of C. album and A. retroflexus germinate throughout the summer. In an attempt to explain the differential germination behavior of these three species in nature, changes in their germination responses to temperature during burial in a non-heated greenhouse from October 1974 to October 1975 were monitored. A high percentage of the seeds of all three species after-ripened during winter. Seeds of A. artemisiifolia and C. album germinated at temperatures characteristic of those in the field in early and mid-spring, but seeds of A. retroflexus required the higher temperatures of late spring and early summer for germination. Seeds of all three species germinated to higher percentages in light than in darkness. Non-dormant seeds of A. artemisiifolia that did not germinate in spring entered secondary dormancy. On the other hand, seeds of C. album and A. retroflexus that did not germinate when temperatures first became favorable for germination, did not enter secondary dormancy and, thus, retained the ability to germinate at summer field temperatures during summer. Thus, temporal differences in the germination behavior of these three species are caused by the differential reaction of the seeds to temperature during the annual temperature cycle. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.},

  Abstract = {Abstract— Studies of the effect of light quality on the growth of Cucurbita pepo L. and Chenopodium album L. showed that large changes in morphological development can be induced by altering the proportion of red and far-red in the incident radiation. Although phytochrome photoequilibria established at the beginning of the dark period affected development, similar changes were achieved with long term and continuous irradiation. The change in the growth pattern of C. album (a common weed species in cultivated land) caused by simulated wheat canopy shade, appeared to involve a redirection of growth towards processes which would achieve greater height at the expense of lateral growth. The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that phytochrome may be involved in the detection of mutual shading and the modification of development in an appropriate manner.

  Abstract = {Summary. The effectiveness of pre-emergence applications of 2,4-D for weed control in maize was studied In five experiments, in comparison with other herbicide treatments. 2,4-D-aimne applied before crop emergence gave satisfactory weed control if the subsequent conditions were wet, but post-emerge nee applications only killed some species (Chenopodium album and Atriplex patula.) A combination of 2,4-D-amine, applied pre-emergence to a moist soil and subsequently as a foliar spray, controlled completely C. album, A. patula, Stellaria media and Veronica spp. Pre-emergence applications of simazine gave better weed control with less need for rain soon after application. Only A. patula was usually resistant. Pre-emergence treatments of atrazine killed all weeds whilst linuron controlled S. media, A. patula., C. album and Sonchus oleraceus but not Veronica spp. Irrigation experiments showed that weed competition for water was largely responsible for the depressions in the early growth of maize when the conditions were dry. Final yield largely reflected the degrees of weed control attained by the herbicidal treatments. Only 2,4-D applied pre-emergence, and followed by heavy rain caused a direct depression in yield.

  Abstract = {Summary. Experiments arc reported that demonstrate that there is mutual interference between kale and Chenopodium album when grown in association. As the plants grow, those at high density, whether in mixtures or in pure stands, interfere with each other and individual plant weight and leaf area are reduced. By changing the time:of Introduction of one of the species into a mixture it was shown that kale suffered heavy mortality when C. album had an initial advantage. When kale was introduced before C. album the weed remained stunted but there was no mortality. The weed exerted an early effect of kale. The ability of C. album to interfere with kale, seems to be related to its plasticity. It is able to grow rapidly, to trap light effectively and even under adverse conditions to set seed.
